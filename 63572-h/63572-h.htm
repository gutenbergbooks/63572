<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">O<span class="sc">nce</span> upon a time, a boy lost his
way in a vast forest that filled
many a valley and passed over many
a hill&mdash;a rolling sea of leaves for miles
and miles, farther than the eye could
reach. His name was Eric, son of the
good King Magnus. He was dressed in
a blue velvet dress, with a gold band
round his waist, and his fair locks in
silken curls waved from his beautiful
head. He was a lovely boy, and if you
looked into his large blue eyes, and saw
his sweet smile, you would say in your
heart, “There is a boy so winning and
brave and true, that I would dearly like
to have him as a friend and companion.”
But, alas! his hands and face were
scratched, and his clothes torn with
the briars, as he ran here and there
like one much perplexed. Sometimes
he made his way through tangled brushwood,
or crossed the little grassy plains
in the forest, now losing himself in dark
ravines, then climbing up their steep
sides, or crossing with difficulty the
streams that hurried through them.
For a long time he kept his heart up,
and always said to himself, “I shall find
it, I shall find it;” until, as the day
advanced, he was wearied and hungry;
and every now and then he cried, “Oh,
my father! where is my father? I’m
lost! I’m lost!” And “Where, oh,
where is my gold thread?”</p>

<p>All day the forest seemed to him to
be very sad. He had never seen it so
gloomy. There was a strange sadness
in the rustle of the leaves, and a sadness
in the noise of the streams. He did not
hear the birds sing as they used to do.
But he heard the ravens croak with
their hoarse voice, as their black forms
swept along the precipices which here
and there rose above the forest, and he
never saw so many large hawks wheeling
in the sky. They always appeared
to be wheeling over his head, pausing,
and fluttering as if about to dart down
upon him. But on he journeyed, in the
hope of finding his way out of the
boundless forest, or of meeting some one
who would be his guide. At last the
sun appeared to be near its setting, and
he could see the high branches of the
trees shining like gold, as its rays from
the west fell upon them. But underneath,
the forest was getting darker and
darker, and all the birds were preparing
to sleep, and everything at last became
so still that he could hear his steps
echoing through the wood, and if he
stopped, he heard his heart beating, or
a leaf falling; but nowhere did he see
a house, and no human being had he
met since morning. Then the wind
suddenly began to rise, and he heard
it at first creeping along the tree-tops
like a gentle whisper, and by-and-by to
call louder and louder for the storm to
come. Dark clouds gathered over the
sky, and rushed along chased by the
winds, that were soon to search the
forest and fight with the old trees. No
wonder if the boy began to fear, in case
some evil would happen to him. Not
that he was a coward, but a very bravehearted
boy; <em>but he had done wrong</em>, and
it was that which made him afraid.</p>

<p>At last, wearied and hardly able to
go further, he sat down at the root of
an old oak, burying his face in his hands,
not knowing what to do. He then tried
to climb the tree, and there to sleep
somewhere among its branches, in case
wild beasts should attack him. But as
he was climbing up, he heard some one
singing with a loud voice. He listened
attentively, and looking eagerly through
the leaves, he saw a boy apparently older
than himself, dressed in rough shaggy
clothes, as if made from skins of wild
animals. His long matted hair escaped
over his cheeks from under a black bearskin
cap. With a short thick stick he
was driving a herd of swine through the
wood. “Hey there, you black porker!”
cried the boy, as he threw a stone at
some pig which was running away.
“Get along, you lazy long snout!” he
shouted to another, as he came thump
on its back with his short stick. And
then he sang this song with a loud voice
which made the woods ring:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Get along, you rascals,” cried the
savage-looking herd, “or I’ll kill and
roast you before your time;” and soon
the herd, with his swine, were concealed
from Eric’s sight by the wood; but he
still heard his “rub-a-dub” chorus, to
which he beat time with a sort of rude
drum, which he had made for himself
with a skin and hoop. Eric determined
to make his acquaintance, or at all
events to follow him to some house; so
he descended from the tree, and ran off
in the direction from which he heard the
song coming. He soon overtook him.</p>

<p>“Hollo!” said the wild-looking lad,
with as much astonishment as if Eric
had fallen from the clouds. “Who?
where from? where to?”</p>

<p>“I have lost my way in the wood,”
said Eric, “and want you to guide me.”</p>

<p>“To Ralph?” asked the swineherd.</p>

<p>“Ralph! pray, who is he?”</p>

<p>“Master, chief, captain, all,” replied
the young savage.</p>

<p>“I will go anywhere for shelter, as
night is coming on; but I will reward
you if you bring me to my father’s
home.”</p>

<p>“Who is your father, my fine fellow?”
inquired the swineherd, leaning on his
stick.</p>

<p>“The king,” replied Eric.</p>

<p>“You lie! Ralph is king.”</p>

<p>“I speak the truth, swineherd.”</p>

<p>The swineherd by this time was examining
Eric’s dress with an impudent
look. “Pay me now,” said he; “give
me this gold band, and I will guide you.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you this gold band, for
my father gave it to me, and I have lost
enough to-day. By the bye, did you see
a gold thread waving anywhere among
the trees?”</p>

<p>“A gold thread! What do you mean?
I saw nothing but pigs until I saw you,
and I shall treat you like a pig, d’ye
hear? and lick you too, for I have no
time to put off. So give me your band.
Come, be quick!” said he, with his fierce
face, and holding up his stick as he came
up to Eric.</p>

<p>“Keep off, swineherd; don’t touch
me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t touch you! why shouldn’t I
touch you? Do you see this stick? How
would you like to have it among your
fine curls, as I drive it among the pigs’
bristles?” and he began to flourish it
over his head, and to press nearer and
nearer. “Once! twice! when I say thrice,
if you do not unbuckle, I shall save you
the trouble, and leave you to the wild
beasts, who would like a tender bit of
prince’s flesh better than pork. Come;
once! twice!”</p>

<p>Eric was on his guard, and said, “I
shall fight you, you young robber, till
death, rather than give you this band&mdash;so
keep off.”</p>

<p>“Thrice!” shouted the herd, and down
came his thick cudgel, which he intended
should fall on Eric’s head.</p>

<p>But Eric sprang aside, and before he
could recover himself, dashed in upon him,
tripped him up, and threw him on the
grass, getting on top of him and seizing
him by the throat in a moment. The
herd, in his efforts to get out of Eric’s
grasp, let go his cudgel, which Eric
seized and held over his head. “Unless
you promise, master swineherd, to leave
me alone, I may leave <em>you</em> alone with
the wild beasts.”</p>

<p>“You are stronger than I thought,”
said the herd. “Let me up, or I shall
be choked. Let me up, I say, and I
promise to guide you.”</p>

<p>“I shall trust you,” said Eric, “though
you would not trust me. Rise!”</p>

<p>So the herd rose and picked up
his cap, but Eric would not give
him his stick until he guided him to
some house. “Come along,” said he
sulkily.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Eric.</p>

<p>“They call me Wolf. I killed a wolf
once with my boar-spear.”</p>

<p>“Why, Wolf, did you try to kill
me?”</p>

<p>“Because I wanted your gold belt.”</p>

<p>“But it is a great sin to rob and kill.”</p>

<p>“Other people rob me, and would kill
me too if I did not take care of their
pigs,” said Wolf carelessly.</p>

<p>“You should fear God, Wolf.”</p>

<p>“I fear that name truly, for Ralph
always swears by it when he is in a
rage. But I do not know what it
means.”</p>

<p>“O Wolf, surely your father and
mother told you about God, who made
all things, and made you and me; God,
who loves us, and wishes us to love Him,
and to do what is right?”</p>

<p>“I have no father or mother,” replied
Wolf, “nor brothers or sisters, and I
never heard of God. No one cares for
me but my pigs, and so I sleep with
them, and eat with them.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” said Eric, with a look
of kindness; “I am sorry for you. Here
is all the money I have. Take it. I
wish to show you that I have no ill will
to you;” and Eric gave him a gold coin.</p>

<p>Wolf gave a grunt like one of his pigs,
and began his song of “Rub-a-dub.”</p>

<p>“No one ever gave me money before,”
remarked Wolf almost to himself, as he
examined the coin on his rough hand,
which looked like tanned leather. “How
much is this?” inquired Wolf.</p>

<p>Eric explained its value. The herd
was astonished, and began to think
what he could purchase with it. He
seemed very anxious to conceal it, and
at last did so in the top of his hairy cap.</p>

 <p class="caption">“See that tall tower,” said Wolf.</p>
</div>

<p>“See that tall tower,” said Wolf,
“which looks like a rock above the
trees; that is the only house near for
twenty miles round. You can reach it
soon; and when you do reach it,” said
Wolf, speaking low, as if some one
might hear him, “take my advice, and
get away as fast as you can from my
master Ralph, for”&mdash;and Wolf gave a
number of winks, as much as to say, I
know something.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Eric.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, nothing; but take
Wolf’s advice, and say to Ralph you
are a beggar. Put the gold band in
your pocket, and swear to remain with
him, but run off when you can. Cheat
him; that’s my way.”</p>

<p>“It is not my way,” replied Eric,
and, come what may, never will be,
for a voice says to me,<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” said Wolf; “I wish you
lived with Ralph. He would teach you
another lesson, my lad.”</p>

<p>“I would rather that I had you, Wolf,
to live in my house. I would be kind
to you, and help you to be good, and
tell you about God, who lives in the
sky.”</p>

<p>“And is that He who is speaking?
Listen!”</p>

<p>Thunder began to mutter in the sky.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is He,” replied Eric; “and
if you listen, you will also hear Him
often speak with a small still voice in
your heart.”</p>

<p>“I never heard Him,” replied Wolf;
“but I cannot stay longer with you, for
my pigs will wander: there is a black
rascal who always leads them astray.
Now, king’s son, give Wolf the stick; it
is all he has.”</p>

<p>“Here it is to you, and I am sure you
will not use it wrongly; you will try
to be good, Wolf? for it will make you
happy.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Wolf, “I am happy
when I get my pigs home, and Ralph
does not strike me. But I must away,
and see you don’t tell any one you gave
me money. They would rob me.” And
away he ran among the trees in search
of his pigs, while Eric heard his little
drum, and his song of “Rub-a-dub,
halloo!” die away in the distance.</p>

<p>Another loud peal of thunder and flash
of lightning made Eric start, and off he ran
towards a light which now beamed from
the tower. But he thought to himself,
“I am much worse than that poor Wolf,
for I knew what was right, and did not
do it. I heard the voice, but did not
attend to it. Oh, my father, why did
I not obey you?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">S<span class="sc">ometimes</span> he lost sight of the light,
and again he caught it, till it became
brighter and brighter, and very
soon he came to a high rock, on the top
of which was perched a tall dark tower.
After groping about, he found a narrow
path that led up to the tower. From
one of the windows of the tower the
light was brightly shining. He went
up a flight of steep steps till he reached
a massive door covered with iron, and
knocked as loud as he could, when a
large dog began barking furiously inside,
and springing up to the door, as
if it would tear it down. Then a gruff
voice called out of a window over the
door, “Who is there? Who disturbs
me in this way?”</p>

<p>The little boy replied, “Please, sir,
I am Eric, son of King Magnus, and
I have lost my way in this wood.”</p>

<p>“The son of the king, are you?”
asked the voice. “That is a grand
joke! Let me have a sight of you.”
Then the window was shut, and he
heard footsteps coming tramp, tramp
down the stairs, and the voice said to
the dog, “Lie down, hound, and don’t
be greedy! You would not eat a young
prince, would you? Lie down!”</p>

<p>The door was then opened by a fierce-looking
man with a long beard. The
man bid him enter, and examined him
about himself and his journey. Eric
answered truly every question.</p>

<p>Then the man rang a bell for an
old woman who lived in the house,
and bid her take the boy with her,
and give him his supper. The old
woman looked very ugly and very cross,
and led Eric up, up, a great number
of dark gloomy stairs, until she reached
a small room, with a bed and table
in it, where she bade Eric wait till
she brought him supper.</p>

<p>The big hound followed them, and
stayed in the room while the woman
went away. Eric was at first afraid
of the dog, he was so large and wild-looking;
but he came and laid his head
on his knee, and Eric scratched his
ears, and patted him, and was very
kind to him. The supper came, and
little Eric managed to keep a few bits
of meat out of his own supper for the
dog, and when the old woman went
out of the room he fed the hound, who
seemed very hungry, and said to him,
“Good dog, I love you very much.”
The dog wagged his tail, and looked
up kindly with his large eyes, for he
was thankful for his supper, and ate
much more than Eric.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old woman gruffly,
when she took away the remains of
the supper, “you have ate what would
do me for a week. You won’t starve,
master prince. Go to bed.”</p>

<p>The old woman left him, but suddenly
returning, she discovered Eric on his
knees. As he rose she scoffed and
jeered him, and asked, “Do you always
say your prayers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, always,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Who taught you?”</p>

<p>“My mother, who is dead.”</p>

<p>The old woman heaved a deep sigh,
but the boy did not know why. Perhaps
she used to pray when she was a little
girl herself, and had given up doing
so, and become wicked; or perhaps she
thought of some child of her own whom
she had never taught to pray. She
then went away without speaking a
word more, and Eric was left in darkness.
He looked out through the narrow
window of his room, but could see nothing
but black clouds rushing over the
sky. Far down he heard a stream roaring,
and the wind, which now blew a
gale, came booming over the tree-tops,
and howling round the tower. Every
now and then a flash lighted up the
forest, and the thunder crashed in the
sky. It was a fearful night!</p>

<p>By-and-by Eric heard footsteps at
his door, and immediately the man with
the beard entered it, and sat down.
“Do you know,” he asked, “where your
father is?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Eric; “as I told you, I
lost my way in the forest, and have
been wandering all day, and cannot
find him; but perhaps you will send
some one to-morrow with me to show
me the way to his castle, and I am
sure my kind, good father will give you
a rich reward.”</p>

<p>“You are very, very far from your
father’s house,” said the man, “and I
fear you will never see him again; but
come with me, and I shall show you
some beautiful things that will please
you.” So the man took Eric by the
hand, and, carrying a bright lamp in
the other, led him into a room that
seemed full of gold and silver, with
beautiful dresses sparkling with diamonds,
and every kind of splendour,
and he said, “Stay with me, my boy,
and I will give you all this, for I am
a king too, and will make you my
heir.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no,” said Eric; “I will never
forsake my own father.”</p>

<p>The man then said, “If you stay with
me, you need never go to school all
day, but may amuse yourself from
morning till night, and have a beautiful
pony to ride, and a gun to shoot deer
with, and also fishing-rods, and a servant
to attend you, and any kind of meat
and drink you like best. Do stay with
me!”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Eric, “but
I cannot be happy without my father.
Oh, my dear father! if I found you I
would never leave you more!”</p>

<p>“Come then with me, my fine fellow,
and I shall show you something different,”
said the man, seizing Eric firmly
by the arm, and looking very fierce.</p>

<p>After walking along a passage, from
the end of which confused noises came,
a door was opened, and in a large hall,
round a great oak table, sat a company
of fierce-looking men, drinking from
large flagons which stood before them.
Their faces were red, and their eyes
gleamed like fire. Ralph placed Eric
on the table. One of the robbers was
singing this song:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>No wonder poor Eric trembled as he
heard that lawless band thus glorying
in their shame, and like demons singing
their horrid song in praise of all
that was most dreadful and most
wicked. He had read stories of robbers,
which sometimes made him think
that they were fine, brave fellows, but
now that he was among them, he saw
how depraved, cruel, and frightful they
were. Their savage, coarse looks terrified
him; but he was held by Ralph
on the table.</p>

<p>When the song was ended, one of
them asked, “Whom have we got
here?”</p>

<p>“Who do you think?” replied Ralph.
“What would you say, my men, to
a young prince&mdash;no less than the son
of our great enemy, King Magnus?”</p>

<p>“A young prince! The son of
Magnus! What a prize!” they exclaimed.
“What shall we do with
him?”</p>

<p>“First of all, let us have his gold
belt,” said Ralph, unbuckling Eric’s
belt. “Ha! what a pretty thing it is!”</p>

<p>“My father gave it to me, and I
don’t wish to part with it. The swineherd
Wolf tried to take it from me,
but I fought him, and kept it,” said
Eric.</p>

<p>“Wolf is a brave young robber,”
replied Ralph, “and he shall have it
for his trouble. In the meantime, my
lad, it is mine. But what, my men,
shall we do with the prince?”</p>

<p>“Kill him,” said one.</p>

<p>“Starve him to death,” said another.</p>

<p>“Put his eyes out, and send him
back to his father,” said a third.</p>

<p>Eric prayed to God, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“I propose,” said Ralph, “to make
him a captain if he will stay with us.”</p>

<p>“Never!” said Eric; “I would rather
die!”</p>

<p>“Let him die, then,” said a fierce
robber; “for his father hung my
brother for killing one of his nobles.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what we will do with
the lion’s whelp,” said Ralph: “let us
keep him in prison, and send a message
to his father that we have him snug in
a den among the mountains, and that,
unless he sends us an immense ransom,
we shall kill him.”</p>

<p>“That will do famously,” said the
robbers; “so off with him!”</p>

<p>Then Ralph led the boy downstairs&mdash;down,
down, until Eric thought they
never would stop&mdash;and at last they
came to an iron door, with great bars on
it, and a large lock, and Ralph turned
to Eric, and said, “I know your father,
and I hate him! for he sends his soldiers
after me, and tries to save travellers
from me; and now I have got his son.
I will keep you here till you die, or
till he pays!” Then he opened the
dungeon door, and thrust Eric in.
When it closed it echoed like thunder
through the passages. Eric lay down
on the dungeon floor, and wept till his
heart seemed to break.</p>

<p>All seemed a strange dream. Oh, how
he repented having disobeyed his father!
and how he seemed to be as bad as the
dreadful robbers in having done what
he pleased, and followed his own will,
instead of doing what was right! After
some time he heard some rustling, as
if high up on the wall, and a voice
whispering “Eric!”</p>

<p>“Who is there?” asked Eric, and his
little heart trembled.</p>

<p>“Silence! quiet! it is Wolf. Here is
a small window in your prison, and I
have opened it outside; climb up, get
out, and run for your life.”</p>

<p>Eric heard no more, but scrambled
in the dark up the rough stones in
the wall until he reached the window.
As he looked out he saw the stars and
the woods. He soon forced his way
through, and dropped down on the
opposite side. Some one caught him
in his arms. It was Wolf.</p>

<p>“Here is your gold band, Eric. I
got it from Ralph; for He who was
speaking in the thunder has been
saying things in my heart. You were
kind to poor Wolf. Now run for your
life! I shall close the window again.
Ralph will never know how you got
out, and he will not open the prison
door till after breakfast. So you have
a long time. Run as long as you can
along that road till you reach a hill,
then cross it and follow a stream. Run
off!”</p>

<p>“Bless you, Wolf!” said Eric; “I
shall never forget you.”</p>

<p>Poor Eric! how he ran, and ran,
beneath the stars! He felt no fatigue
for a time. He thought he heard the
robbers after him; every time the wind
blew loud, he imagined it was their
wild cry. On he ran till he reached
the hill, and crossed it, and came to a
green spot beneath a rock, when he
could run no more, but fell down, and
whether he fainted or fell asleep he
could not tell.</p>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">E<span class="sc">ric</span> knew not how long he slept,

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i0a">“Rest thee, boy, rest thee, boy, lonely and weary,</div>

 </div><!--end poem-->

<p>Eric opened his eyes, but moved not
a limb, as if under some strange fascination.
It was early morning. High overhead
a lark was also “singing like an
angel in the clouds.” The mysterious
voice went on in the same beautiful
and soothing strain,<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“Oh, sweet is the lark as she sings o’er her nest,</div>

 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Eric could neither move nor speak;
but in his heart he confessed with
sorrow that he had done what was
wrong. And again the voice sang,<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“Now, darling, awaken! Thou art not forsaken!</div>
  <div class="i2">The old night is past and a new day begun.</div>

 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>“I shall arise and go to my father!”
said Eric, springing to his feet. He saw
beside him a beautiful lady, who looked
like a picture in his father’s room of his
dead mother, or like one of those angels
from heaven about whom he had often
read.</p>

<p>And the lady said, “Fear not! I
know you, Eric, and how it came to
pass that you are here. Your father
sent you for a wise and good purpose
through the forest, and gave you hold
of a gold thread to guide you, and told
you never to let it go; but instead of
doing your duty, and keeping hold of
the thread, you let it go to chase butterflies
and gather wild berries and to
amuse yourself. This you did more
than once. You neglected your father’s
counsels and warnings, and so you lost
your thread, and then you lost your way.
What dangers and troubles have you
thus got into through disobedience to
your father’s commands, and want of
confidence in his love and wisdom! But
if you had only trusted your father’s
directions, the gold thread would have
brought you to his beautiful castle,
where there is to be a happy meeting
of your friends, with all your brothers
and sisters.” Poor little Eric began to
weep! “Listen to me, child,” said the
lady kindly, “for <em>you cannot have peace
but by being good</em>. Do you know, all
your brothers and sisters made this
very journey by help of the gold
thread, and they are at home with
great joy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, save me, save me!” cried Eric,
and caught the lady’s hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall save you,” said she, “if
you will learn obedience. I know and
love you, dear boy. I know and love
your father, and have been sent by him
to deliver you. I heard what you said,
and know all you did, last night, and
I was very glad that you proved your
love to your father, and your love of
truth, and your love of others, and this
makes me hope all good of you for the
future. Come now with me.”</p>

<p>And so the beautiful woman took him
by the hand. The storm had passed
away, and the sun was shining on the
green leaves of the trees, and every drop
of dew sparkled like a diamond. The
birds were all warbling their morning
hymns, and feeding their young ones
in their nests. The streams were also
dancing down the rocks and through
the glens. “The mountains broke forth
into singing, and all the trees clapped
their hands with joy.” Everything thus
seemed so happy to Eric, for he himself
was happy at the thought of doing what
was right, and of going home. The lady
led him to a sunny glade in the wood,
covered with wild flowers, from which
the bees were busy gathering their
honey, and she said, “Now, child, are
you willing to do your father’s will?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!”</p>

<p>“Will you do it, whatever dangers
may await you?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I must tell you that
your father has given me the gold
thread you lost; and he bids me remind
you that if you keep hold of it, and
follow it wherever it leads, you are sure
to come to him at sunset; but if you let
it go, you may wander on in this dark
forest till you die, or are again taken
prisoner by robbers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you,” said Eric, “for such
good news! I am resolved to do my
duty, come what may.”</p>

<p>“May you be helped to do it!” said
the lady. She then gave him a cake,
to support him in his journey. “And
now, child,” she added, “one advice
more I will give you, and it was given
you by your father, though you forgot
it; it is this&mdash;if ever you feel the thread
slipping from your hands, or are yourself
tempted to let it go, pray immediately,
and you will get wisdom and
strength to find it, to lay hold of it, and
follow it. Before we part, kneel down
and ask assistance to be good and obedient,
brave and patient, until you meet
your father.”</p>

<p>The little boy knelt down and repeated
the Lord’s Prayer; and as he
said, “Thy will be done on earth, as it is
done in heaven,” he felt calm and happy
as he used to do when he knelt at his
mother’s knee, and he thought her hand
was on his head, and that she kissed his
cheek and blessed him. When he lifted
up his head there was no one there but
himself; but he saw an old gray cross,
and a <span class="sc">Gold Thread</span> was tied to it, and
passed away, away, shining through the
woods.</p>

<p>With a firm hold of his gold thread,
the boy began his journey home. He
passed along pathways on which the
brown leaves of last year’s growing were
thickly strewn, and from among which
flowers of every colour were springing.
He crossed little brooks that ran like
silver threads and tinkled like silver
bells. He went under trees with huge
trunks, and huge branches that swept
down to the ground and waved far up
in the blue sky. The birds hopped about
him, and looked down upon him from
among the green leaves, and they sang
him songs, and some of them seemed to
speak to him. He thought one large
bird like a crow cried, “Good boy, good
boy!” and another whistled, “Cheer up,
cheer up!” and so he went merrily on,
and very often he gave the robins and
blackbirds that came near him bits of
his cake.</p>

<p>After a while, he came to a green spot
in the middle of the wood, without trees,
and a footpath went direct across it, to
the place where the gold thread was
leading him, and there he saw a sight
that made him wonder and pause. It
was a bird about the size of a pigeon,
with feathers like gold and a crown like
silver, and it was slowly walking not far
from him, and he saw gold eggs glittering
in a nest among the grass a few
yards off. Now he thought it would be
such a nice thing to bring home a nest
with gold eggs! The bird did not seem
afraid of him, but stopped and looked at
him with a calm blue eye, as if she said,
“Surely you would not rob me?” He
could not, however, reach the nest with
his hand, and though he pulled and
pulled the thread, it would not yield
one inch, but seemed as stiff as a wire.</p>

<p>“I see the thread quite plain,” said
the boy to himself, “the very place
where it enters the dark wood on the
other side. I will just jump to the nest,
and in a moment I shall have the eggs
in my pocket, and then spring back and
catch the thread again. I cannot lose
it here, with the sun shining; and, besides,
I see it a long way before me.”
So he took one step to seize the eggs;
but he was in such haste that he fell
and crushed the nest, breaking the eggs
to pieces, and the little bird screamed
and flew away; and then all at once the
birds in the trees began to fly about,
and a large owl flew out of a dark glade,
and cried, “Whoo&mdash;whoo&mdash;whoo-oo-oo!”
and a cloud came over the sun!</p>

<p>Eric’s heart beat quick, and he made
a grasp at his gold thread, but it was
not there! Another, and another grasp,
but it was not there! and soon he saw
it waving far above his head, like a
gossamer thread in the breeze. You
would have pitied him, while you could
not have helped being angry with him
for having been so silly and disobedient
when thus tried, if you had only seen
his pale face, as he looked above him
for his thread, and about him for the
road, but could see neither! And he
became so confused with his fall, that
he did not know which side of the open
glade he had entered, nor to which point
he was travelling. But at last he
thought he heard a bird chirping, “Seek&mdash;seek&mdash;seek!”
and another repeating,
“Try again&mdash;try again&mdash;try&mdash;try!” and
then he remembered what the lady had
said to him, and he fell on his knees and
told all his grief, and cried, “Oh, give
me back my thread! and help me never,
never, to let it go again!”</p>

<p>As he lifted up his eyes, he saw the
thread come slowly, slowly down; and
when it came near, he sprang to it
and caught it, and he did not know
whether to laugh, or cry, or sing, he
was so thankful and happy! “Ah!”
said he, “I hope I shall never forget
this fall!” That part of the Lord’s
Prayer came into his mind which says,
“Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil.”</p>

<p>“Who would have thought,” said he
to himself, “that I was in any danger
in such a beautiful, green, sunny place
as this!”</p>

<p>Then on he went, and a large crow
on a tree was hoarsely croaking, “Beware,
beware!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Crow,” said the boy,
“I shall;” and he threw him a bit of
bread for his good advice, and ran on
gaily to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>But now the thread led him through
the strangest places. One was a very
dark deep ravine, with a stream that
roared and rushed far down, and overhead
the rocks seemed to meet, and
thick bushes concealed the light, and
nothing could Eric see but the gold
thread, that looked like a thread of fire,
though even that grew dim sometimes,
until he could only feel it in his hand.
And whither he was going he knew not.
At times he seemed to be on the edge
of a precipice, until he almost thought
the next step <em>must</em> lead him over and
plunge him down; but just when he
came to the very edge, the thread would
lead him quite safely along it. Then
appeared a rock which looked like a
wall, and he would say to himself,
“Well, I must be stopped here! I
shall never be able to climb up!” But
just as he touched it, he would find steps
cut in it, and up, up, the thread would
lead him to the top! Then it would
bring him down, down, until he once
stood beside a raging stream, and the
water foamed and dashed. “And now,”
he would think, “I must be drowned;
but never mind, I will not let my
thread go.” But so it was, that when
he came so near the stream as to feel
the spray upon his cheek, and thought
he must leap in if he followed his thread,
what would he see but a little bridge
that passed from bank to bank, and
by which he crossed in perfect safety;
until he began to lose fear, and to believe
more and more that he would always
be in the right road, as long as he did
not trust mere appearances, but kept
hold of his thread!</p>

<p>At last Eric got very tired and hungry,
for his cake was nearly done, and he
had started early, and it was now well
on in the day. But what was very
strange, the thread supported him more
than a staff could have done, and seemed
to lift him up from the ground and
make him go lightly along.</p>
</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">E<span class="sc">ric</span> had now to endure a great trial
of his faith in the thread. As he
journeyed on, the thread led him up
a winding path towards the summit of
a hill, descending which the large trees
of the forest were left behind, and small
stunted bushes grew among masses of
gray rocks. The path was like the bed
of a dry brook, and was often very steep.
There were no birds, except little stonechats,
that hopped and chirped among
the large round stones. Far below, he
could see the tops of the trees, and here
and there a stream glittering under the
sunbeams. Nothing disturbed the silence
but the hoarse croak of the raven, or the
wild cry of a kite or an eagle, that, like
a speck, wheeled far up in the sky. But,
suddenly, Eric heard a roar like thunder,
that seemed to come from the direction
towards which the thread was leading
him. He stopped for a moment, but
the thread was firm in his hand and
led right up the hill. On he went, and
no wonder he was afraid, when, as he
turned the corner of a rock, he heard
another roar, and saw the head of a
large lion looking out of what seemed
to be a cave, a few yards back from the
edge of a dizzy precipice! He saw, too,
that the path he must follow was between
the lion’s den and the precipice!
What now was to be done? Would he
give up his thread and fly? No! A
voice in his heart encouraged him to
be brave and not fear, and he knew
from his experience that he had always
been led in safety and peace when he
followed the road, holding fast to his
thread. He was certain that his father
never would deceive him, or bid him
do anything but what was right; and
he was sure, too, that the lady, from
her love to him, and her teaching him
to trust God and to pray, would not
have bid him do anything that was
wrong. And then an old verse his nurse
taught him came into his mind,<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“Fear not to do right,</div>
  <div class="i2">Fear not the grave;</div>
  <div class="i0">But fear to do wrong,</div>
  <div class="i2">Your life to save.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>All this, and much more, passed
through little Eric’s mind in a minute,
and so he resolved to go on, come what
might. There was just one thing he
saw which cheered him, and that was a
white hare, sitting with her ears cocked,
quite close to the lion’s den, and he
wondered how she had no fear, but could
not explain it at the time. On he went,
but he could hardly breathe, as the thread
led still nearer and nearer the den. These
big eyes were glaring on him, and seemed
to draw him closer and closer! There
the lion was, on one side of the path,
and the great precipice on the other.
One step more, and he was between
them. He went on until he was so
near that he seemed to feel the lion’s
breath, when suddenly he sprang out
on him, and tried to strike him with
his huge paw that would have crushed
him to the dust! Eric shut his eyes,
and gave himself up for lost. But the
lion suddenly fell back, for he was held
fast by a great iron chain, and so Eric
passed in safety!</p>

<p>Oh! how thankful he was! and how
gladly he ran downhill, the lion roaring
behind him in his den. Down he ran
until all was quiet again. As he pursued
his journey in the beautiful green woods,
something told him his greatest trial was
past. He felt very peaceful and strong.
And now, as he reached some noble old
beech-trees, the thread fell on the grass,
and he took this as a sign that he should
lie down too, and so he did, grateful
for the rest. He ate some of his cake
that tasted so nice, and drank from a
clear spring beside him, and gathered
wild strawberries which grew in abundance
all round him, and thus had quite
a feast. He then stretched himself on
his back among soft moss, and looked
up through the branches of the gigantic
trees, and watched with delight the sunlight
speckling the emerald green leaves
and brown bark with touches of silver,
and, far up, the deep blue sky with
white clouds reposing on it, like snowy
islands on a blue ocean; and he watched
the squirrels with their bushy tails, as
they ran up the trees, and jumped from
branch to branch, and sported among
the leaves, until he fell into a sort of
pleasant day-dream, and felt so happy,
he hardly knew why.</p>

<p>As he lay here, he thought he heard
in his half-waking dream a little squirrel
sing a song. Was it not his own heart,
now so glad because doing what was
right, which was singing? This was the
song which he thought he heard:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As Eric opened his eyes and looked
up, he saw a little squirrel with its tail
curling up its back, sitting on a branch
looking down upon him; and then it
playfully ran away with the tail waving
after it. “Farewell, happy little
fellow!” said Eric; “I must do my
work now, and play like you afterwards;”
for now the thread again became
tight, and Eric, refreshed with his
rest, and hearty for his journey, stepped
out bravely. He saw, at some distance
beyond an open glade in the forest,
a rapid river towards which he was
descending, when he thought he perceived
something struggling in the
stream, and then heard a loud cry or
scream for help, as if from one drowning.
He was almost tempted to run off to his
assistance without his thread, but he
felt thankful that the thread became
tight again, and led in the very direction
from whence he heard the cries
coming. So off he ran as fast as he
could, and as he came to the brink of
a deep, dark pool in the river, he saw
the head of a boy rising above the water,
as the poor little fellow tried to keep
himself afloat. Now he sank&mdash;again he
rose&mdash;until he suddenly sank down and
did not again appear. Eric laid hold
of his thread with a firm hand and
leaped in over head and ears, and then
rose to the surface, and with his other
hand swam to where the boy had disappeared.
He soon caught him, and
brought him with great difficulty to the
surface, which he never could have done
unless the thread had supported them
both above the water.</p>

<p>“Eric!” cried the gasping boy, opening
his eyes, almost covered by his long
wet hair.</p>

<p>“Wolf, is it you?” It was indeed poor
Wolf, who lay panting on the dry land,
with his hairy clothes dripping with
water, and himself hardly able to speak.
“Oh, tell me, Wolf, what brought you
here? I am so glad to have helped you!”</p>

<p>After a little time, when Wolf could
speak, he told him in his own way, bit
by bit, how Ralph had suspected him;
and how the old woman had heard him
speaking as she was looking out of an
upper window; and how when Ralph
asked the gold belt he could not give
it; and how he was obliged himself to
fly; and how he had been running for
his life for hours. “Now let us fly,”
said Wolf; “I am quite strong again.
I fear that they are in pursuit of us.”</p>

<p>They both went on at a quick pace,
Eric having shown Wolf the thread he
had asked him about the day before, and
explained to him how he must never part
with it, come what might. “Oh, rub-a-dub,
dub!” said Wolf, squeezing the
water out of his hair, as he trotted
along; “I am glad to be away. Ralph
would have killed me like a pig. The
voice told me to run after you.” So on
they went as fast as they could, when
suddenly Wolf stopped, and listening
with anxious face he said, “Hark! did
you hear anything?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Eric; “what was it?”</p>

<p>“Hush!&mdash;listen!&mdash;there again&mdash;I hear
it!”</p>

<p>“I think I do hear something far off
like a dog’s bark,” replied Eric. “Hark!”</p>

<p>So they both stopped and listened, and
far away they heard a deep “Bow-wow-wow-wow-o-o-o-o-o”
echoing through the
forest.</p>

<p>“Let us run as fast as we can,” said
the boy, in evident fear; “hear him&mdash;hear
him!”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow-wow-o-o-o-o,” and the
sound came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>“What is it? why are you so afraid?”
anxiously inquired Eric.</p>

<p>“Oh! that is Ralph’s bloodhound,
Tuscar,” cried Wolf, “and he is following
us. He won’t perhaps touch me,
but you he may.” So Eric ran as fast
as he could, but never let go the gold
thread, which this time led up a steep
hill, which they were obliged to scramble
up. “Run, Eric!&mdash;quick&mdash;hide&mdash;up a
tree&mdash;anywhere!”</p>

<p>“I cannot, I dare not,” said Eric;
“whatever happens, I must hold fast
my thread.”</p>

<p>But they heard the “Bow-wow-o-o-o”
coming nearer and nearer, and as they
looked back they saw an immense hound
rush out of the wood, and as he came
to the water he saw the boys on the
opposite hill, and so he leaped into the
stream, and in a few minutes would be
near them. And now he came bellowing
like a fierce bull up the hill, his tongue
hanging out, and his nose smelling along
the ground, following their footsteps.</p>

<p>“I shall run and meet him,” said Wolf,
“and stop him if I can;” and down ran
the swineherd, calling “Tuscar! Tuscar!
good dog, Tuscar!”</p>

<p>But though Tuscar knew Wolf, he
passed him, and ran up to Eric. As he
reached Eric, who stood calm and firm,
the bloodhound stopped panting, smelling
his clothes all round, but, strange to
say, wagging his huge tail, and then ran
back the way he had come, as if he had
made a mistake, and all his race was for
nothing! It was the large hound Eric
had fed! So his kindness was not lost
even on the dog.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">E<span class="sc">ric</span> and Wolf now pursued their
journey with light and hopeful
hearts, for they had got out of what
was called the wild robber country, and
he knew that he was drawing near
home. The thread was stronger than
ever, and every hour it helped more
and more to support him. On the two
went together, Wolf trotting along with
his short stick, and sometimes snorting
and blowing with fatigue like one of
his own pigs. They conversed as best
they could about all they had seen.</p>

<p>“Did you see big Thorold the lion?”
asked Wolf.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Eric; “he is very awful,
but he was chained.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for you,” said Wolf, “for
Ralph hunts with him and kills travellers.
He will obey none but Ralph.
I heard him roaring. He is hungry.
He once ate one of my pigs, and would
have ate me if he had not first caught
the porker. I escaped up a tree.”</p>

<p>And thus they talked, as they journeyed
on through woods, and across
green plains, and over low hills, until,
as they were walking along, Wolf complained
of hunger. Eric at once gave
him what remained of his large cake;
but it did not suffice to appease the
appetite of the swineherd, who was,
however, very grateful for what he got.
To their delight they now saw a beautiful
cottage not far from their path,
and, as they approached it, an old
woman with a pretty girl, who seemed
to be her daughter, came out to meet
them.</p>

<p>“Good-day, young gentleman!” said
the old woman, with a kind smile and
a courtesy; “you seem to be on your
travels, and look wearied. Pray come
into my cottage, and I shall refresh
you.”</p>

<p>“What lucky fellows we are!” said
Wolf.</p>

<p>“We are much obliged to you for your
hospitality,” replied Eric. But alas! the
thread drew him in an opposite direction;
so turning to Wolf he said, “I
cannot go in.”</p>

<p>“Come, my handsome young gentleman,”
said the young woman, “and we
shall make you so happy. You shall
have such a dinner as will delight you,
I am sure; and you may remain as long
as you please, and I shall dance and
sing to you; nor need you pay anything.”
And she came forward smiling
and dancing, offering her arm to Eric.
“Surely you won’t be so ungallant as
refuse me! you are so beautiful, and
have such lovely hair and eyes, and I
never saw such a belt as you wear: do
come!”</p>

<p>“Come, my son,” said the old woman to
Wolf, as she put her hand round his neck.</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” replied Wolf;
“for, to tell the truth, I am wearied
and hungry: such offers as yours one
does not get every day.”</p>

<p>“I cannot go,” again said Eric. <em>They</em>
could not see the thread, for to some
it was invisible; but <em>he</em> saw it, and felt
it like a wire passing away from the
cottage. “Who are you, kind friends?”
inquired Eric.</p>

<p>“Friends of the king and of his family.
Honest subjects, good people,” said the
old woman.</p>

<p>“Do you know Prince Eric?” asked
Wolf.</p>

<p>“Right well!” replied the young
woman. “He is a great friend of
mine; a fine tall comely youth. He
calls me his own little sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” said Eric; “you do
not know him. You should not lie.”
But he did not tell her who he was,
neither did Wolf, for Eric had made a
sign to him to be silent. “I won’t enter
your dwelling,” said Eric, “for my duty
calls me away.”</p>

<p>They both gave a loud laugh, and said,
“Hear him! Only hear a fine young
fellow talking about duty! Pleasure,
ease, and liberty are for the young. We
only want to make you happy: come!”</p>

<p>“I shall go with you,” said Wolf; “do
come, Eric.”</p>

<p>“Wolf, speak to me,” said Eric, whispering
to the swineherd. “You know <em>I</em>
cannot go, for my duty tells me to follow
the thread. But now I see that this is
the house of the wicked, for you heard
how they lied; they neither knew the
king nor his children; and they laugh,
too, at duty. Be advised, Wolf, and
follow me.”</p>

<p>Wolf hesitated, and looked displeased.
“Only for an hour, Eric.”</p>

<p>“Not a minute, Wolf. If you trust
them more than me, go; but I am sure
you and I shall never meet again.”</p>

<p>“Then I will trust you, Eric,” said Wolf;
“the voice in my heart tells me to do so.”</p>

<p>And so they both passed on. But
the old woman and the girl began to
abuse them, and call them all manner
of evil names, and to laugh at them as
silly fellows. The girl threw stones at
them, which made Wolf turn round and
flourish his stick over his head. At last
they re-entered the cottage, the old woman
shaking her fist, and calling out from
the door, “I’ll soon send my friend
Ralph after you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! is that the way the wind
blows?” exclaimed the swineherd, with
a whistle; and, grasping Eric’s arm,
said, “You were right, prince! I never
suspected them. I see now they are bad.”</p>

<p>“I saw that before,” replied Eric,
“and knew that no good would come
to us from making their acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Were they not cunning?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but probably, with all their
smiles, flattery, and fair promises, they
would have proved more cruel in the
end than either Ralph or old Thorold.”</p>

<p>“What would they have done to us?
Why did they meet us? Who are they,
think you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Wolf; it was enough
for me that they lied, and did not wish
us to do what was right.”</p>

<p>Not long after this strange adventure
they reached a rising ground from which
a magnificent view burst upon them.
Below there was a large lake, surrounded
by wooded hills, above which rose noble
rocks fringed with stately pines, and
higher ranges of mountains beyond, some
of whose summits were covered with
snow that glittered like purest alabaster
in the azure blue of the sky. Eric gave
a cry of joy; for he saw the house of
one of his father’s foresters, where he
had once been with his father. “Wolf!
Wolf!” he exclaimed, “look yonder; that
is the house of Darkeye the forester. We
are safe!” and the thread was leading
straight down in the very direction
which they wished.</p>

<p>Darkeye’s house was built on a small
green island in the lake. The island
was like a little fort, for on every side
the rocks descended like a wall. It
could only be approached by a boat,
which Darkeye kept on the island, and
then by a narrow stair cut out of the
rock. No robbers could thus get near
it, and Darkeye was there to give shelter
to travellers, and to help any of the
poor who had to pass that way. The
thread led down to the shore and the
narrow ferry. They forgot their fatigue,
and ran down till they reached the ferry.
“Boat ahoy!” shouted Eric.</p>

<p>By-and-by two boys were seen running
out of the cottage, and after looking
cautiously at those who were calling for
the boat, they rowed off, and soon were
at the shore, where stood Eric with
his gold belt, and Wolf in his rough
skins. “Don’t you remember me?”
asked Eric. The boys looked astonished
as they recognized the young
prince, and received him joyfully into
their boat, he holding by the thread,
which seemed to cross the ferry towards
the cottage.</p>

<p>How many questions were mutually
put and answered in a few minutes!
They told him their father was at home;
and how he had lately seen the king;
and how the king was anxiously looking
for Eric’s return; and how glad all on
the island would be to see him. And
the younger boy told him how they
had a tame otter, that fished in the
lake, and a fine golden eagle which
they had got young in her nest, that
lived on the island with them; and
how their mother had got another baby
since he had been there, and how happy
they all were, and so on, until they
arrived at the island. And there was
old Darkeye himself waiting to receive
them; and when he saw who was in
the boat, he ran down the stone steps
and grasped the young prince’s hand,
and drew him to his heart. “Welcome,
welcome!” said he; “I knew you had
been in the forest, but your father would
not tell me anything more about you.
He only said that he longed for your
coming home. But who is this?” asked
Darkeye, pointing to Wolf.</p>

<p>“A friend of mine,” said Eric, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“My name is Wolf,” grunted the
swineherd.</p>

<p>“I think I have seen him before.
But no! What? Yes!” said Darkeye,
examining him; then added, as if he
had discovered some old acquaintance,
“Surely I <em>have</em> seen him. Tell me, my
fine fellow, did you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was evident Darkeye had seen Wolf
killing his game, or in some affray with
the robbers. Wolf looked steadily at
Darkeye, then at Eric, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“O Darkeye, do not trouble poor
Wolf, but let him go into the cottage,
and come you with me, as I wish to
tell you all that has happened to me
during these few days.”</p>

<p>So, while the boys took Wolf to the
cottage, and food was being prepared,
Eric told Darkeye all his adventures;
and you would have been sure that the
forester was hearing something which
surprised and interested him wonderfully,
had you seen his face, and how
he sometimes laughed, or knit his brows
and looked angry, or sad and solemn,
or sprang to his feet from the rock on
which he was sitting beside Eric.</p>

<p>When Eric came to speak about the
old woman and her daughter, “Ah!”
said Darkeye, “there are not worse
people in that wicked country! They
say that the old woman is a witch of
some kind. But whether she poisons
travellers or drowns them, I know not.
No doubt she is in league with Ralph
the robber, and would have robbed you
or kept you fast in some way or other
till you were handed over to him. You
were right, my prince, in all you did.
The only way of being delivered from
temptation is to be brave, and do what
is right, come what may.” At last,
grasping Eric by the hand, he led him
back to the cottage. There Darkeye’s
wife received him like a mother, and
all the children gathered round him in
surprise and admiration, he looked so
brave and lovely.</p>
</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">O<span class="sc">ne</span> of the walls of the cottage was
reared on the edge of the rock,
so that it seemed a continuation of it,
and to rise up from the deep waters of
the lake. The boys were thus able often
to fish with a long line out of the window.
A winding stair led to a look-out
on the roof, from which the whole island,
called “The Green Island of the Lake,”
could be seen. It was about a mile or
more in circumference, and was dotted
all over with the cottages of the other
foresters and king’s huntsmen, each
surrounded with clumps of trees, through
which the curling smoke from the chimneys
might be seen ascending. There
were everywhere beautifully kept gardens,
with fruits, and flowers, and beehives;
and fields, too, with their crops.
On the green knolls and in the little
valleys might be seen cows and sheep;
while flocks of goats browsed among ivy-covered
rocks.</p>

<p>In the middle of the island was a
little shallow lake, beside which the
otter had his house among the rocks;
and there the eagle also lived. All the
children in the island were the best of
friends, and they played together, and
sailed their boats on the little lake,
and every day met in the house of one
of the foresters to learn their lessons;
and on Sunday, as they were very far
away from any church, old Darkeye
used to read good books to them, and
worship with them, and did all he could
to make them good and happy. They
often met at such times in the open
air, beneath a large tree which sheltered
them from the sun.</p>

<p>There was also in the island a house
where, by the king’s orders, all poor
travellers could find refuge and refreshment.
And it was a great pleasure to
the boys and girls to visit them; and
if they were sick and confined to bed,
to read to them, and attend to their
wants. If the stranger had any children,
the young islanders always shared their
sports with them. And nothing pleased
these stranger children more than to get
leave to sail a boat, or to have the
loan of a fishing-rod, or to hear the
boys call Oscar&mdash;for that was the name
of the otter&mdash;out of his den, and play
with Tor the eagle; or to see them
feed Oscar with some of the fish they
had caught, and Tor with a bit of meat.
The dogs were so friendly, too, that they
never touched Oscar, but would swim
about in the same pool with him. And
so all were happy in the Green Island;
because Darkeye had taught them what
a wicked thing selfishness was, and that
the only way to be happy was by thinking
about others as well as themselves,
and by loving one another. He also
used to say: “Now, when you work,
work like men, and when you play,
play like boys: be hearty at both.”
And so while there was no idleness,
there was abundance of recreation.</p>

<p>Another evil was never permitted in
the island, and that was disobedience
to parents, or want of respect to the
old. But, indeed, punishment for these
offences was seldom or never needed.
The young learned to <em>like</em> to do what
was right, and were too brave and
manly to give pain and trouble to
others.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned, also, that
they had a little band of musicians.
One beat the drum, a few played the
fife, and others some simple instrument;
while almost all could sing
tolerably well in parts. Thus, many a
traveller would pause and listen with
delight as he heard on a summer’s
evening the chorus song from many
voices, or the music from the band
coming from the island. “Young
people,” Darkeye used to say, “have
much wealth and happiness given
them, if they only used their gifts.”</p>

<p>But I am forgetting Eric and Wolf.
They were both, you may be sure,
ready for their dinner, and there was
laid for them on a table, cream, cakes,
and fresh trout, and such other good
things as the kind woman could get
ready.</p>

<p>But now the thread began to move,
as if it wished Eric to move also.
Before rising to depart, he told Wolf
how Darkeye, for his sake, would be
so glad to take care of him, until he
got his father’s permission to bring
him into the castle; that he would
learn to be a huntsman, and be taught
what was good, and to know about
the voice that spoke in his heart, and
that all the boys in the island would
make him their friend if he did what
was right.</p>

<p>“Ralph will come here!” said Wolf,
hanging his head.</p>

<p>“I wish the rascal did,” said Darkeye,
“for he would never go back.
But he cannot enter my fort, and
knows me and my huntsmen too well
ever to try it. I have had more than
one brush with the villain, and we
hope soon to drive him and his brood
from their bloody nest. Wolf, you are
welcome and safe, for Eric’s sake!”
Then turning to Eric, he said, “I shall
teach him, and make a man of him,
my young prince, depend upon it.
And now, before we part, I have to
ask a favour,” continued Darkeye. “You
know our custom near evening? If the
thread permits, remain and be one of
us.”</p>

<p>“I remember it,” said Eric, “and will
remain and be one of you, and let poor
Wolf also be one.”</p>

<p>And so they entered the cottage, and
all sat down round an open window
which looked out upon the beautiful
lake dotted with wooded islands, and
surrounded by the noble forest, above
which rose the giant peaks and precipices.
The water was calm as glass,
and reflected every brilliant colour from
rock and tree, and, most of all, from
the golden clouds, which already began
to gather in the west. Darkeye read
from the Blessed Book of one who had
left his father’s house, and went to a

<p>Then they knelt down, and Darkeye
spoke to God in the name of them all,
thanking Him for His goodness, and
telling Him their wants. When they
rose from their knees, the gold thread
shone brilliantly, and, like a beam of
light, passed out at the door in the
direction of the ferry. During the
singing of the verses, Wolf seemed for
the first time quite overcome. He bent
his head, and covered his face with his
hands. He then said, in a low voice,
when the short service was over, and
as if speaking to himself, while all were
silent listening to him, “I had a dream.
Long, long ago. A carriage&mdash;a lady.
She was on her knees crying. She had
hold of me. Ralph was there and the
robbers. I forget the rest.” He rose
and looked out of the window, gazing
vacantly.</p>

<p>“What can he mean?” asked Eric
aside to Darkeye, who was looking
tenderly on Wolf.</p>

<p>“Ah! who knows, poor boy! Singing
always touches the heart of these
wanderers. Perhaps&mdash;yes&mdash;it may be,”
he said, so that Eric alone could hear
him, “that he has been taken when a
child by Ralph from some rich traveller,
and perhaps his mother was killed! He
may have been the child of good people.
Was that his mother who prayed for
him? If so, her prayers are now
answered, for her boy will be delivered&mdash;poor
Wolf!&mdash;Wolf, my boy,” said
Darkeye, “come and bid farewell to
your friend.”</p>

<p>Wolf started as from a dream, and
came to Eric.</p>

<p>“Farewell, my kind Wolf, and I hope
some day to see you in my father’s
house.” The swineherd spoke not a
word, but wiped his eyes with the back
of his rough hand. “Cheer up, Wolf,
for you will be good and happy here.”</p>

<p>“Wolf is happy already, and he will
take care of the pigs, or do anything
for you all.” He then held out his
stick to Eric, and said, “Take it; it is
all Wolf has: Ralph has the gold coin.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, good Wolf; but you will
require it, and I need nothing to remember
you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, Eric, for what I did
in the forest when we met. My heart
is sorry.”</p>

<p>“We did not know one another then,
Wolf, and I shall never forget that to
you I owe my escape.”</p>

<p>“Wolf loves you, and every one here.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you do, Wolf, and I love
you. God bless you, Wolf, I must go;
farewell!”</p>

<p>And so they parted. But all gathered
round Eric, and accompanied him to the
boat, blessing the little prince, and wishing
him a peaceful and happy journey.
Eric thanked them with many smiles
and tender words. Darkeye alone went
with him into the boat, wondering
greatly at the thread, and most of all
at the prince, who shone with a beauty
that seemed not of this world. The
prince landed, but Darkeye knew for
many reasons that he could not accompany
him in his journey, which he
must take alone. Eric landed on the
shore, embraced Darkeye, and waving
his hand to all on the island, he soon
was lost to their sight in the great
forest.</p>

<p>A winding pathway, over the ridge of
hills, led down to a broad and rapid but
smooth river, and on its banks was a
royal boat, beautiful to look upon. The
thread led into the boat, and though no
one was there, Eric entered, and sat on
a velvet cushion on which the golden
thread laid itself down. No sooner had
he gone on board of the boat, than&mdash;as
if his little foot, when it touched her,
had sent her from the shore&mdash;she slowly
moved into the centre of the channel,
and was carried downwards by the
current. On she swept on the bosom
of that clear stream, between shores
adorned with all that could delight the
eye&mdash;rocks and trees and flowers, with
here and there waterfalls, white as snow,
from mountain rivulets which poured
themselves into the great river. The
woods were full of song, and birds with
splendid plumage gleamed and flashed
amidst the foliage like rainbow hues
amidst the clouds.</p>

<p>Eric knew not whither he was being
carried, but his heart was sunshine and
peace. On and on he swept with the
winding stream, until at last darting
under a dark archway of brick, and then
emerging into light, the boat grounded
on a shore of pure white sand, while the
thread rose and led him to the land.</p>

<p>No sooner had he stepped on shore
and ascended the green bank, than he
found himself at the end of a long, broad
avenue of splendid old trees, whose tops
met in a green arch overhead. The far-off
end of the avenue was closed by a
great stair of pure white marble steps
which ascended to a magnificent castle.
Wall rose above wall, and tower over
tower. He saw grand flights of stairs,
leading from one stately terrace to
another, with marble statues, clear gushing
fountains, and flower gardens, and
every kind of lovely tree. It was his
father’s castle at last! He ran on with
breathless anxiety and joy. He soon
reached it. A large gate was before
him, that seemed to be covered with
glittering gold. The thread led directly
to it. As he reached the door, he saw
the thread tied to a golden knocker,
shaped like the old cross in the forest.
Inscribed over the door were the words,
“He that persevereth to the end shall be
saved.” And on the knocker, “Knock,
and it shall be opened.” He seized the
knocker, and the moment it fell, the
thread broke and vanished. A crash
of music was heard inside. The door
opened, and there stood Eric’s father,
surrounded by his brothers and sisters;
and the beautiful lady was there too,
and many, many more to welcome Eric.
His father clasped him to his heart, and
said, “My son was lost, but is found!”</p>

<p>While all crowded around Eric with
his weary feet and torn dress, kept
together by his golden band, a chorus
was heard singing,<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">“And a little child shall lead them.”</p>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">“W<span class="sc">ee Davie</span>” was the only child
of William Thorburn, blacksmith.
The child had reached the age
in which he could venture, with prudence
and reflection, on a journey from one
chair to another, his wits kept alive
by maternal warnings of “Tak’ care,
Davie; mind the fire, Davie.” And
when his journey was ended in safety,
and he looked over his shoulder with
a cry of joy to his mother, he was
rewarded, in addition to the rewards
of his own brave and adventurous spirit,
by such a smile as equalled only his
own, and by the well-merited approval
of “Weel done, Davie!”</p>

<p>Davie was the most powerful and
influential member of the household.
Neither the British fleet, nor the French
army, nor the Armstrong gun, nor the
British Constitution had the power of
doing what Davie did. They might as
well have tried to make a primrose
grow or a lark sing! He was, for example,
a wonderful stimulus to labour.
His father, the smith, had been rather
disposed to idleness before his son’s
arrival. He did not take to his work
on cold mornings as he might have
done, and was apt to neglect many
opportunities which offered themselves
of bettering his condition; and Jeanie
was easily put off by some plausible
objection when she urged her husband
to make an additional honest penny to
keep the house. But “the bairn” became
a new motive to exertion; and
the thought of leaving him and Jeanie
more comfortable, in case sickness laid
the smith aside, or death took him
away, became like a new sinew to his
powerful arm, as he wielded the hammer,
and made it ring the music of hearty
work on the sounding anvil. The
meaning of benefit-clubs, sick-societies,
and penny-banks was fully explained
by “wee Davie.”</p>

<p>Davie also exercised a remarkable
influence on his father’s political views
and social habits. The smith had been
fond of debates on political questions,
and no more sonorous growl of discontent
than his could be heard against
the powers that be, the injustice done
to the masses, and the misery which
was occasioned by class legislation. He
had also made up his mind not to be
happy or contented, but only to endure
life as a necessity laid upon him, until
the required reforms in Church and
State, at home and abroad, had been
attained.</p>

<p>But his wife, without uttering a
syllable on matters which she did not
pretend even to understand, and by a
series of acts <em>out</em> of Parliament, by
reforms in household arrangements, by
introducing good <em>bills</em> to her own House
of Commons, and by a charter, whose
points were chiefly very commonplace
ones, such as a comfortable meal, a tidy
home, a clean fireside, a polished grate,
above all, a cheerful countenance and
womanly love&mdash;these <em>radical</em> changes
had made her husband wonderfully fond
of his own house. He was, under this
teaching, getting every day too contented
for a patriot, and too happy for
a man in such an ill-governed world.
His old companions could not at last
coax him out at night. He was lost
as a member of one of the most
philosophical clubs in the neighbourhood.
His old pluck, they said, was
gone. The wife, it was alleged by the
patriotic bachelors, had “cowed” him,
and driven all the spirit out of him.
But “wee Davie” completed this revolution.</p>

<p>One failing of William’s had hitherto
resisted Jeanie’s silent influence. The
smith had formed the habit, before he
was married, of meeting a few companions,
“just in a friendly way,” on
pay-nights at a public-house. It was
true that he was never “what might
be called a drunkard,” “never lost a
day’s work,” “never was the worse of
liquor,” etc. But, nevertheless, when he
entered the snuggery in Peter Wilson’s
whisky shop, with the blazing fire and
comfortable atmosphere; and when,
with half a dozen talkative and, to
him, pleasant fellows and old companions,
he sat round the fire, and the
glass circulated, and the gossip of the
week was discussed, and racy stories
were told, and one or two songs sung,
linked together by memories of old
merry meetings; and current jokes
were repeated, with humour, of the
tyrannical influence which some would
presume to exercise on “innocent social
enjoyment”&mdash;then would the smith’s
brawny chest expand, and his face
beam, and his feelings become malleable,
and his sixpences begin to melt, and
flow out in generous sympathy into
Peter Wilson’s fozy hand, and there
counted beneath his sodden eyes. And
so it was that the smith’s wages were
always <em>minus</em> Peter’s gains.</p>

<p>His wife had her fears&mdash;her horrid
anticipations&mdash;but did not like to “even”
her husband to anything so dreadful as
what she in her heart dreaded. She
took her own way, however, to win
him to the house and to good, and
gently insinuated wishes rather than
expressed them. The smith, no doubt,
was only “merry,” and never was ill-tempered
or unkind; “yet at times&mdash;”
“and then, what if&mdash;” Yes, Jeanie,
you are right! The demon sneaks into
the house by degrees, and at first may
be dispelled, and the door shut upon
him; but let him only once take possession,
then he will keep it, and shut
the door against everything pure, and
lovely, and of good report, and bar it
against thee and “wee Davie,” ay, and
against better than thee and than all
else, and fill the house with sin and
shame, with misery and despair! But
“wee Davie,” with his arm of might,
drove the demon out.</p>

<p>It happened thus. One evening when
the smith returned home so that “you
would know <em>it</em> on him,” his child toddled
to him, and, lifting him up, he made him
stand before him on his knee. The child
began to play with the locks of the
Samson, and to pat him on the cheek,
and to repeat with glee the name of
“dad-a.” The smith gazed at him intently,
and with a peculiar look of love,
mingled with sadness.</p>

<p><a name="illo" id="illo"></a>“Isn’t he a bonnie bit bairn?” asked
Jeanie, as she looked over her husband’s
shoulder at the child, nodding and smiling
to him.</p>

<p>The smith spoke not a word, but
gazed still upon his boy, while some
sudden emotion was strongly working
in his countenance. “It’s done!” he at
last said, as he put his child down.</p>

<p>“What’s wrang? what’s wrang?” exclaimed
his wife, as she stood before
him, and put her hands round his
shoulders, bending down until her face
was close to his.</p>

<p>“Everything is wrang, Jeanie!”</p>

<p>“Willie, what is’t? are ye no’ weel?&mdash;tell
me what’s wrang wi’ you?&mdash;oh, tell
me!” she exclaimed in evident alarm.</p>

<p>“It’s a’ richt noo!” he said, rising
up, and seizing his child, lifted him up
to his breast, and kissed him. He then
folded him in his arms, clasped him to
his heart, and looking up in silence,
said, “Davie has done it, along wi’
you, Jeanie. Thank God, I am a free
man!”</p>

<p>His wife felt awed, she knew not how.</p>

<p>“Sit doon,” he said, as he took out
his handkerchief and wiped away a
tear from his eye, “and I’ll tell you a’
aboot it.”</p>

<p>Jeanie sat on a stool at his feet, with
Davie on her knee.</p>

<p>Her husband seized his child’s little
hand with one of his own, and with
the other took his wife’s. “I havena
been what ye may ca’ a drunkard,” he
said, “but I hae been often as I shouldna
hae been, and as, wi’ God’s help, I never,
never will be again!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jeanie.</p>

<p>“Let me speak,” said William. “To
think, Jeanie”&mdash;here he struggled as if
something was choking him&mdash;“to think
that for whisky I might beggar you
and wee Davie; tak’ the claes aff your
back; drive ye to the workhouse; break
your heart; and ruin my bonnie bairn,
that loves me sae weel, in saul and body,
for time and for eternity! God forgie me!
I canna stand the thocht o’t, let alane
the reality!” and the strong man rose,
and little accustomed as he was to show
his feelings, he kissed his wife and child.
“It’s done, it’s done!” he said; “dinna
greet, Jeanie. Thank God for you and
Davie, my best blessings.”</p>

<p>“Except Himsel’!” said Jeanie, as
she hung on her husband’s neck.</p>

<p>“Amen!” said the smith; “and noo,
woman, nae mair aboot it; it’s done.
Gie wee Davie a piece, and get the
supper ready.”</p>

<p>“Wee Davie” was also a great promoter
of social intercourse, an unconscious
link between man and man, and
a great practical “unionist.” He healed
breaches, reconciled differences, and was
a peace-maker between kinsfolk and
neighbours. For example: Jeanie’s parents
were rather opposed to her marriage
with the smith; some said because they
belonged to the rural aristocracy of
country farmers. They regretted, therefore,
the day&mdash;though their regret was
expressed only to old friends&mdash;when the
lame condition of some of the horses
had brought Thorburn into communion
with their stable, and ultimately with
their house. Thorburn was admitted
to be a sensible, well-to-do man; but
then he was, at best, but a smith, and
Jeanie was good-looking, and “by ordinary,”
with expectations of some “tocher,”
and as her mother remarked, “though I
say it, that shouldna say it,” etc., and
so, with this introduction, she would
proceed to enlarge on Jeanie’s excellences,
commenting on the poor smith
rather with pauses of silence, and expressions
of hope “that she might be
mistaken,” all of which, from their very
mystery, were more depreciatory than any
direct charges. But when “wee Davie”
was born, the old couple deemed it
proper and due to themselves&mdash;not to
speak of the respect due to their
daughter, whom they sincerely loved&mdash;to
come and visit her. Her mother
had been with her, indeed, at an earlier
period; and the house was so clean,
and Thorburn so intelligent, and the
child pronounced to be so like old David
Armstrong, Jeanie’s father, especially
about the forehead, that the two families,
as the smith remarked, were evidently
being welded, so that a few more gentle
hammerings would make them one.</p>

<p>“Wee Davie,” as he grew up, became
the fire of love which heated the hearts
of good metal so as to enable favourable
circumstances to give the necessary finishing
stroke which would permanently
unite them. These circumstances were
constantly occurring until, at last, Armstrong
called on every market-day to
see his daughter and grandson, and he
played with the boy (who was his only
grandson), and took him on his knee,
and put a “sweetie” into his mouth,
and evidently felt as if he himself was
reproduced and lived in the boy. This
led to closer intercourse, until David
Armstrong admitted that William Thorburn
was one of the most sensible men
he knew, and that he would not only
back him against any of his acquaintances
for a knowledge of a good horse, but for
wonderful information as to the state
of the country generally, especially of
the landed interest and the high rent of
land. Mrs. Armstrong finally admitted
that Jeanie was not so far mistaken in
her choice of a husband. The good
woman always assumed that the sagacity
of the family was derived from her side
of the house. But whatever doubts still
lingered in their minds as to the marriage,
these were all dissipated by one look of
“wee Davie.” “I’m just real proud aboot
that braw bairn o’ Jeanie’s,” she used to
say to her husband. She added one day,
with a chuckling laugh and smile, “D’ye
no’ think yersel’, gudeman, that wee
Davie has a look o’ auld Davie?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, maybe,” replied auld Davie;
“but I aye think he’s our ain bairn we
lost thirty years syne.”</p>

<p>“That has been in my ain mind,” said
his wife; “but I never liked to say it.
But he’s no’ the waur o’ being like
baith.”</p>

<p>Again: There lived in the same common
passage, and opposite to William
Thorburn’s door, an old soldier, a pensioner.
He was a bachelor, and by no
means disposed to hold much intercourse
with his neighbours. The noise of the
children was obnoxious to him. He
maintained that “an hour’s drill every
day would alone make them tolerable.
Obedience to authority; right about,
march! That’s the thing,” the Corporal
would say to some father of a numerous
family in the “close,” as he flourished
his stick with a smile rather than a
growl. Jeanie pronounced him to be
“a selfish body.” Thorburn had more
than once tried to cultivate acquaintance
with him, as they were constantly
brought into outward contact. But the
Corporal was a Tory, and more than
suspected the smith of holding “Radical”
sentiments. To defend things as they
were was a point of honour with the
pensioner&mdash;a religion. Any dislike to
the Government seemed a slight upon
the army, and therefore upon himself.
Thorburn at last avoided him, and pronounced
him proud and ignorant. But
one day “wee Davie” found his way
into his house, and putting his hands
on his knees as he smoked his pipe at
the fireside, looked up to his face. The
old soldier was arrested by the beauty
of the child, and took him on his knee.
To his surprise, Davie did not scream;
and when his mother soon followed in
search of her boy, and made many
apologies for his “impudence,” as she
called it, the Corporal maintained that
he was a jewel, a perfect gentleman,
and dubbed him “the Captain.”</p>

<p>Next day, tapping at Thorburn’s door,
the Corporal gracefully presented a toy
in the shape of a small sword and
drum for his young hero. That night
he smoked his pipe at the smith’s fireside,
and told such stories of his battles
as fired the smith’s enthusiasm, called
forth his praises, and, what was more
substantial, a most comfortable tea by
Jeanie, which clinched their friendly
intercourse. He and “the Captain”
became constant associates, and many
a loud laugh might be heard from the
Corporal’s room as he played with the
boy, and educated his genius. “He makes
me young again, does the Captain!”
remarked the Corporal to his mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fergusson, another neighbour,
was also drawn into the same net by
“wee Davie.” She was a fussy, gossiping
woman, noisy and disagreeable. She
found Jeanie uncongenial, who “kept
herself to herself,” instead of giving away
some of her good self to her neighbour,
and thus taking some of her neighbour’s
bad self out of her. But her youngest
child became seriously ill, and Jeanie
thought, “If Davie was ill I would like
a neighbour to speir for him,” and so
she went upstairs to visit Mrs. Fergusson,
and begged pardon, but “wished to know
how Mary was?” and Mrs. Fergusson was
bowed down with sorrow, and thanked
her, and bid her “to come ben.” And
Jeanie did so, and spoke kindly to the
child, and told her, moreover, what
pleasure it would give her to nurse her
baby occasionally; and she invited the
younger children to come down to her
house and play with “wee Davie,” and
thus keep the sick one quiet; and she
helped also to cook some nutritive drinks,
and got nice milk from her father for
the sick one, and often excused herself
for apparent meddling by saying, “When
one has a bairn o’ their ain, they canna
but feel for other folk’s bairns.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fergusson’s heart became subdued,
softened, and friendly, and she
said, “We took it as extraordinar’ kind
in Mrs. Thorburn to do as she has done.
It is a blessing to have sic a neighbour.”</p>

<p>But it was “wee Davie” did it.</p>

<p>The street in which the smith lived
was as uninteresting as any could be.
A description of its outs and ins would
have made a “social science” meeting
shudder. Beauty or even neatness it
had not. Every “close” or “entry” in
it looked like a sepulchre. The back
courts were a huddled confusion of outhouses;
strings of linens drying; stray
dogs searching for food; pigeons similarly
employed with more apparent success
and satisfaction; and cats creeping
about; with crowds of children, laughing,
shouting, and muddy to the eyes, acting
with intense glee the great dramas of life,
marriages, battles, deaths, and burials,
with castle-building and extensive farming
and commercial operations. But
everywhere smoke, mud, wet, and an
utterly uncomfortable look. And so long
as we in Scotland have a western ocean
to afford an unlimited supply of water,
and western mountains to condense it
as it passes in the blue air over their
summits, and western winds to waft it
to our cities, and so long as it will pour
down, and be welcomed by smoke above
and earth below&mdash;then consequently so
long we shall find it difficult to be “neat
and tidy about the doors,” or to transport
the cleanliness of England into our
streets and lanes. But, in spite of all
this, how many cheerful homes, with
bright fires and nice furniture, and rows
of books, and intelligent, sober, happy
men and women, with healthy, nice children,
are everywhere to be found in those
very streets, that seem to the eye of
those who have never penetrated farther
than their outside, to be “dreadful-looking
places;” and who imagine that all
their inhabitants must be like pigs in
pigstyes, steeped in wretchedness and
whisky; and infer that every ignorant
and filthy and drunken Irish brawler
and labourer is a fair type of the whole
of our artisans.</p>

<p>There is, I begin to suspect, a vast
deal of exaggerated nonsense written
about the working classes. Be that as
it may, I feel pretty certain of this, that
there is no country on earth in which
the skilled and well-conducted artisan
can get so much for his money, socially,
physically, intellectually, and morally, as
in our own Britain, and none in which
there are to be found so many artisans
who take advantage of these benefits.
But for the ignorant and ill-disposed,
the idle and the drunken, there is no
country where their degradation is more
rapid, and their ruin more sure. The
former can easily rise above the mud,
and breathe a free and happy atmosphere;
but if he falls into it, it is likely
he will be sooner smothered and buried
than anywhere else on earth.</p>

<p>A happier home could hardly be found
than William Thorburn’s, smith, as he
sat, after coming home from his work,
at the fireside, reading his newspaper,
or some book of weightier literature,
Jeanie sewing opposite to him, and, as
it often happened, both absorbed occasionally
in the rays of that bright light,
“wee Davie,” which filled their dwelling,
and the whole world, to their eyes; or
listened to the grand concert of his
happy voice, which mingled with their
busy work and silent thoughts, giving
harmony to all. How much was done
for his sake! He was the most sensible,
efficient, and thoroughly philosophical
missionary of social science in all its
departments who could enter that house.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">M<span class="sc">y</span> heart is sore as I write it,
that “wee Davie” got ill. He
began to refuse his food, and nothing
would please him; then to get peevish
and cross, so that he would hardly go
to his father, except to kiss him with
tearful cheeks, and then stretch out his
hands with a cry for his mother. His
mother nursed him on her knee, and
rocked him, and walked with him, and
sang to him her own household lullabies;
and put him to bed, and lifted him up,
and laid him down, and “fought” with
him day and night, caring for neither
food nor sleep, but only for her child’s
ease and comfort. What lessons of self-sacrificing
love was she thus unconsciously
taught by her little sufferer!
The physician was at last called in, who
pronounced it “a bad case&mdash;a <em>very</em>
serious case.” I forget the specific
nature of the illness. The idea of
danger to Davie had never entered the
minds of his parents. The day on
which William realized it, he was, as
his fellow-workmen expressed it, “clean
stupid.” They saw him make mistakes
he had never made before, and knew
it could not be from drink, but could
not guess the cause. “I maun gang
hame!” was his only explanation, when,
at three o’clock, he put on his coat
and stalked out of the smithy, like
one utterly indifferent as to what the
consequences might be to ploughs or
harrows, wheels or horse-shoes. Yet
taking an old fellow-workman aside, he
whispered to him, “For auld friendship
sake, Tam, tak’ charge this day o’
my wark.”</p>

<p>“What ails Willie?” was the only
question put by him and others, to
which no reply could be given.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of next day
that “the minister” called. It must
here be confessed that William was a
rare attender of any church. The fact
was, he had been hitherto rather sceptical
in his tendencies; not that his doubts
had ever assumed a systematic form, or
had ever been expressed in any determined
or dogmatic manner. But he had
read Tom Paine, associated the political
rights of man with rebellion against all
old authorities, all of whom seemed to
him to have denied them, and he had
imbibed the idea at the old “philosophical”
club, that ministers, especially
those of the Established Church, were
the enemies of all progress, had no
sympathy with the working classes, were
slaves to the aristocracy, preached as a
mere profession and only for their pay,
and had, moreover, a large share of
hypocrisy and humbug in them. The
visit of Dr. M‘Gavin was, therefore, very
unexpected.</p>

<p>When the Doctor entered the house,
after a courteous request to be allowed
to do so, as it was always his principle
that the poorest man was entitled to
the same respect as the man of rank
or riches, he said, “I have just heard
from some of your neighbours, whom I
have been visiting, that your child is
seriously unwell, and I thought you
would excuse me intruding upon you
to inquire for him.”</p>

<p>William made him welcome and begged
him to be seated. The call was specially
acceptable to Jeanie. Old David, I
should have mentioned, was an “elder”
in a most worthy dissenting congregation,
and his strong religious convictions
and church views formed in his mind a
chief objection to the marriage of his
daughter with a man “who was not,”
as he said, “even a member of any kirk.”
Jeanie had often wished her husband
to be more decided in what she felt
herself to be a duty and a privilege.
The visit of the Doctor, whose character
was well known and much esteemed,
was therefore peculiarly welcome to her.
In a little while the Doctor was standing
beside the little bed of the sufferer, who
was asleep, and gently touching “wee
Davie’s” hand, he said, in a quiet voice,
to the smith, “My brother, I sincerely
feel for you! I am myself a father, and
have suffered losses in my family.”</p>

<p>At the word <em>losses</em>, William winced,
and moved from his place as if he felt
uneasy.</p>

<p>The Doctor quickly perceived it, and
said, “I do not, of course, mean to
express so rash and unkind an opinion
as that you are to lose this very beautiful
and interesting boy, but only to show
you how I am enabled, from experience,
to understand your anxiety, and to sympathize
with you and your wife.” And
noiselessly walking to the arm-chair
near the fire, he there sat down, while
William and Jeanie sat near him.
After hearing with patience and attention
the account from Jeanie of the
beginning and progress of the child’s
disease, he said, “Whatever happens,
it is a comfort to know that God our
Father is acquainted with all that you
suffer, all you fear, and all you wish;
and that Jesus Christ, our Brother, has
a fellow-feeling with us in all our infirmities
and trials.”</p>

<p>“The Deity must know all,” said
William, with a softened voice; “He
is infinitely great and incomprehensible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Doctor; “and so
great, that He can attend to our
smallest concerns; yet not so incomprehensible
but that a father’s heart
can truly feel after Him, so as at least
to find Him through His Son. Ah!
my brother,” continued the Doctor,
“what a comfort and strength the
thought is to all men, and ought to
be to you working men, and to you
parents, especially with your dear child
in sickness, that He who marks a
sparrow fall, smitten by winter’s cold,
and who feeds the wild beasts, is
acquainted with us, with our most
secret affairs, so that even, as it were,
the hairs of our heads are numbered;
that He who is the Father, Almighty
Maker of the heavens and the earth,
knows the things which we need; that
He has in us, individually, an interest
which is incomprehensible, only because
His love to us is so in its depth; that
He considers each of us, and weighs all
His dealings towards us with a carefulness
as great as if we alone existed
in His universe; so that, as a father
pitieth his children, He pitieth us,
knowing our frames, and <em>remembering</em>
we are dust.”</p>

<p>William bent his head and was silent,
while Jeanie listened with her whole
soul.</p>

<p>“It is not easy, minister,” said
William, breaking silence, “for hard-wrought
and tried men to believe
that.”</p>

<p>“Nor for any man,” replied the
Doctor. “I find it very difficult to
believe it myself as a real thing, yet
I know it to be true; and,” he continued,
with a low and affectionate
voice, “perhaps we never could have
known it and believed it at all, unless
God had taught it to us by the life of
His own Son, who came to reveal Him.
But as I see <em>Him</em> taking up little
children into His loving arms, when
others would keep them away who did
not understand what perfect love was,
and as I see in such doings how love
cannot but come down and meet the
wants of its smallest and weakest
object, oh! it is then I learn in what
consists the real greatness of God,
‘whose name is Love.’” The Doctor
paused for a moment, and then went
on: “Because, my brother, I see in
this love of Christ more than the love
of a good man merely; I see revealed
in it the loving tenderness towards us
and ours of that God whom no eye
hath seen or can see, but whom the
eye of the spirit can perceive; for, as
Jesus said, ‘He who seeth <em>Me</em>, seeth
the Father.’”</p>

<p>“I believe a’ ye say, Doctor,” said
Jeanie meekly. “<em>I</em> wadna like to keep
my bairn frae Him; but, oh! sir, I
hope&mdash;I hope He wull lift him up,
and do to us now as He did to many
distressed ones while on earth!”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said the Doctor, “God will
spare your boy; but you must ask
Him sincerely so to do, and you must
trust Him, and commit your child into
His hands without fear, and acquiesce
in His doing towards you and your
boy as He pleases.”</p>

<p>“That is hard!” remarked William.</p>

<p>“Hard?” mildly replied the Doctor.
“What would you choose else, had you
the power of doing so, rather than of
acquiescing in the will of God? Would
you trust your own heart, for instance,
more than the heart of God? or would
you rather have your child’s fate decided
by any other on earth than by yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, for I know how I love the boy.”</p>

<p>“But God loves him much more than
you do; for he belongs to God, and was
made by Him and for Him.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Doctor, but yet I canna
thole the thocht o’ parting wi’ him!”
said Jeanie.</p>

<p>“May God spare him to you, my
friends!” replied the minister, “if it
be for your good and his. But,” he
added, “there are worse things than
death.”</p>

<p>This remark, made in almost an
under voice, was followed by silence
for a few moments. The Doctor’s eyes
were cast down as if in meditation or
prayer.</p>

<p>“Death is hard enough!” said the
smith.</p>

<p>“But hard chiefly as a sign of something
worse,” continued the minister.
“Pardon me for asking you such questions
as these:&mdash;What if your child
grew up an enemy to you? What if
he never returned your love? What if
he never would trust you? What if he
never would speak to you? What if
he always disobeyed you? Would this
not bring down your gray hairs with
sorrow to the grave?”</p>

<p>“Eh! sir,” said Jeanie, “that <em>would</em>
be waur than death!”</p>

<p>“But excuse me, Doctor, for just
remarking,” interrupted William, “that
I never knew any child with a good
parent who would so act. I really
don’t think it possible that our ain
wee Davie, even with our poor bringing
up, would ever come to <em>that</em>. It
would be so unnatural.”</p>

<p>“God knows, Thorburn,” said the
Doctor. “There are many unnatural
things in this world. Listen to me
kindly; for I sincerely thank you for
having allowed one who is a stranger
to speak so frankly to you, and for
having heard me with such considerate
patience.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gang on, gang on, Doctor; I
like to hear you,” said Jeanie.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” added the smith.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the Doctor, “I
have no wish to appear even to find
fault with you at such a time. I feel
more disposed to weep with you in
your sorrow than to search your heart
or life for sin. But I feel at such
solemn times as these, solemn to you
and to your wife, that the voice of a
Father is speaking to you in the rod,
and it ought to be heard; and that
His hand is ministering discipline in
time, and you ought to give Him
reverence, and be in subjection to the
Father of our spirits that you may
live; and therefore, in order to impart
to you more strength and comfort in
the end, let me beseech of you, after
I am gone, to consider candidly whether
you have not perhaps been acting towards
<em>your</em> Father in heaven in the
very way in which did your child grow
up and act towards you would be
reckoned as worse than death. Therefore
honestly ask yourselves whether
there has been from you love to God
your Father in return for His love to
you. Has there been cordial friendship
or the reverse? Confidence or
distrust? Disobedience or rebellion?
Communion in frank, believing, and
affectionate prayer, or silence? I do
not ask you to reply to me; but I
wish you and myself, as loving fathers
of our children, to ask whether we
have felt and acted towards the best
and most loving of fathers as we wish
our children to feel and act towards
ourselves.” The Doctor paused for a
moment. Jeanie shook her head slowly,
and the smith stared with her at the
fire. “My friends, we have all sinned,
and this is our sin of sins, that we
have <em>not known nor loved our Father</em>,
but have been forgetful of Him, strange,
shy to Him; yes, we have been cold,
heartless, prodigal, disobedient children.”
Another short pause, and the Doctor
then spoke on in the same quiet and
loving voice&mdash;“But whatever we are or
have been, let us hope in God, or we
perish. Every sinner is doomed, but
no man is doomed to be a sinner. God
is our Father still; and just as you
both have nourished and cherished your
dear boy, and have been loving when
he knew it not, nor could understand
that great love in your hearts which,
sure am I, will never grow cold but
in the grave, so has it been with God
to us His children. Open your hearts
to His love, as you would open your
eyes to the light which has been ever
shining. Believe it as the grand reality,
as you would have your boy open his
heart to and believe in your love when
he awakens from his sleep. Your love,
as I have said, is deep, real to your
boy, irrespective of his knowledge or
return of it. But what is this to the
love of God? ‘<em>Herein</em> is love, not that
we loved God, but that He loved us,
and gave His Son to be a propitiation
for our sins.’ Let us, my friends, never
rest till we are enabled in some degree
to see and to appreciate this, and to
say, ‘We have known and believed the
love which God has to us.’”</p>

<p>“Dr. M‘Gavin,” said William, “you
have spoken to me as no man ever
did before, and you will believe me,
I am sure, when I say that I respect
you and myself too much to
flatter you. But there is surely a meaning
in my love to that boy which I
never saw before. It begins to glimmer
on me.”</p>

<p>“Thank God if it does! But I do
not speak to you&mdash;and this you must
give me credit for&mdash;as if it were my
profession only; I speak to you as a
man, a father, and a brother, wishing
you to share the good which God has
given to me and gives to you. So I
tell you again, and would repeat it and
repeat it, that if we would only have
to God that simple confidence, hearty
love, frank, cheerful communion, peace
and joy, which we wish our children to
have towards us, we would experience
a true regeneration. And what was
the whole life of Jesus Christ save a
life of this blessed, confiding, obedient,
childlike sonship? Oh, that we would
learn of Him, and grow up in likeness
to Him! But this ignorance of God is
worse than death. For if knowledge
be life, spiritual ignorance is death.
My good friends, I have been led to
give you a regular sermon!” said the
Doctor, smiling; “but I really cannot
help it. To use common everyday language,
I think our treatment of God
has been shameful, unjust, and disgraceful
on the part of men with
reason, conscience, and heart. I do not
express myself half so strongly as I
feel. I am ashamed and disgusted
with myself, and all the members of
the human family, for what we feel,
and feel <em>not</em>, to such a Father. If it
were not for what the one Elder
Brother was and did, the whole family
would have been disgraced and ruined
most righteously!”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said William, with a trembling
voice, “thank ye, thank ye, from
my heart. I confess I have been very
careless in going to the church, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We may talk of that again, if you
allow me to return to-morrow. Yet,”
continued the Doctor, pointing to the
child, “God in His mercy never leaves
Himself without a witness. Look at
your child, and listen to your own
heart, and remember all I have said,
and you will perhaps discover that
though you tried it you could not fly
from the Word of the Lord. A father’s
voice by a child has been preaching to
you. Yes, Thorburn, when in love God
gave you that child, He sent an eloquent
and holy missionary to your
house to preach the gospel of what our
Father is, and what we as children
ought to be. Only listen to that
sermon, and you will soon be prepared
to listen to others.”</p>

<p>The Doctor rose to depart. Before
doing so, he asked permission to pray,
which was cheerfully granted. Wishing
to strengthen the faith of those sufferers
in prayer, he first said, “If God
<em>cannot</em> hear and answer prayer, He is
not supreme; if He <em>will</em> not, He is not
our Father. But blessed be His name,
His own Son, who knew Him perfectly,
who Himself prayed, and was heard in
that He prayed, has enabled our parental
hearts, from our love to our own
children, to feel the beauty and truth
of this His own argument, ‘Ask, and
it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be
opened unto you: for every one that
asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
findeth; and to him that knocketh, it
shall be opened. Or what man is there
of you, whom, if his son ask bread, will
he give him a stone? Or if he ask a
fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye
then, being evil, know how to give good
gifts unto your children, how much
more shall your Father which is in
heaven give good things to them that
ask Him!’” And then the Doctor
poured forth a simple, loving, and most
sympathizing prayer, in which he made
himself one with his fellow-worshippers,
and expressed to a common Father the
anguish of the hearts around him.
When it ended, he went to the bed,
and looked at the sleeping child,
touched its white hand, and said, “God
bless your little one! May this sleep
be for health!”</p>

<p>“It’s the first sleep,” said Jeanie,
“he has had for a lang time. It may
be a turn in his complaint.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to force the parents
to give him an immediate reply to what
he had taught them, the Doctor shook
them warmly by the hand, and gazed
on them with a world of interest in his
eyes, asking them only kindly to consider
what he had said. The silence
which ensued for a few minutes after
his absence, as William and Jeanie
returned from the door and stood
beside the bed, was broken by the
smith observing, “I am glad that
man came to our house, Jeanie. Yon
was indeed preaching that a man can
understand and canna forget. It was
wee Davie did it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Jeanie; “thank
God for’t!” And after gazing on the
sleeping child, she added, “Is he no’
bonnie? I dinna wunner that sic a
bairn should bring gude to the house.”</p>

<p>That night William had thoughts in
his heart which burned with a redder
glow than the coals upon the smithy
fire! I am much mistaken if he did
not begin to feel that God had sent
him a home missionary in “wee Davie.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 negindent dropcap">I<span class="sc">t</span> was a beautiful morning in spring,
with blue sky, living air, springing
grass, and singing bird; but William
Thorburn had not left his house that
morning, and the door was shut.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fergusson trod the wooden stair
that led to the flat above his with slow
and cautious step; and as she met her
boy running down whistling, she said,
“What d’ye mean, Jamie, wi’ that
noise? Do ye no’ ken wee Davie is
dead? Ye should hae mair feeling,
laddie!”</p>

<p>The Corporal, whose door was half
open, crept out, and in an under-breath
beckoned Mrs. Fergusson to speak to
him. “Do you know how they are?”
he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, shaking her head.
“I sat up wi’ Mrs. Thorburn half the
night, and left Davie sleeping, and
never thocht it would come to this.
My heart is sair for them. But since
it happened the door has been barred,
and no one has been in. I somehow
dinna like to intrude, for, nae doot,
they will be in an awfu’ way aboot
that bairn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder&mdash;I don’t wonder!”
remarked the Corporal meditatively;
“I did not believe I could feel as I
do. I don’t understand it. Here am
I, who have seen men killed by my
side. I have seen a single shot cut
down half our company.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“It is certain,” said the Corporal;
“and I have charged at Pampeluna&mdash;it
was there I was wounded&mdash;over dead
and dying comrades, yet, will you
believe me? I never shed a tear&mdash;never;
but there was something in
that Captain&mdash;I mean the boy”&mdash;and
the Corporal took out his snuff-box,
and snuffed vehemently. “And what
a brave fellow his father is! I never
thought I could love a Radical; but
he was not what you call a Radical;
he was&mdash;I don’t know what else, but
he is a man, an out-and-out man, every
inch of him; I’ll say that for him&mdash;a
man is William Thorburn! Have you
not seen his wife?”</p>

<p>“No, poor body! It was six o’clock
when she ran up to me, no’ distracted
either, but awfu’ quiet like, and
wakened me up, and just said, ‘He is
awa’;’ and then afore I could speak she
ran doon the stair, and steekit the
door; and she has such a keen speerit,
I dinna like to gang to bother her.
My heart is sair for her.”</p>

<p>They both were silent, as if listening
for some sound in William Thorburn’s
house, but all was still as the grave.</p>

<p>The first who entered it was old
David Armstrong and his wife. They
found Jeanie busy about her house, and
William sitting on a chair, staring into
the fire, dressed with more than usual
care. The curtains of the bed were up.
It was covered with a pure white sheet,
and something lay upon it which they
knew.</p>

<p>Jeanie came forward, and took the
hand of father and mother, without a
tear on her face, and said quietly,
“Come ben,” as she gave her father a
chair beside her husband, and led her
mother into an inner room, closing the
door. What was spoken there between
them I know not.</p>

<p>William rose to receive old David,
and said, “It was a fine spring day.”
David gave a warm squeeze to his
hand, and sat down. He rose and
went to the bed. William followed
him, and took the cloth off the boy’s
face in silence. They both gazed on
it. The face was unchanged, as in
sleep. The flaxen curls seemed to
have been carefully arranged, for they
escaped from under the white cap, and
clustered like golden wreaths around the
silvery forehead and cheeks. William
covered up the face, and both returned
to their seats by the fireside.</p>

<p>“I never lost ane since my ain wee
Davie dee’d, and yours, Willie, was
dear to me as my ain,” exclaimed the
old man, and then broke down, and
sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>William never moved, though his
great chest seemed to heave; but he
seized the poker and began to arrange
the fire, and then was still as before.
By-and-by, the door of the inner room
opened, and Jeanie and her mother
appeared, both of them composed and
serene. The same scene was repeated
as they passed the bed. Mrs. Armstrong
seated herself beside her husband, and
Jeanie placed a large Bible on the table,
and, pointing to it, said, “Father,” and
then drew her chair near the smith.</p>

 <p class="caption">William never moved, though his great chest seemed to heave.</p>
</div>

<p>David Armstrong put on his spectacles,
opened the Bible, and selecting a portion
of Scripture, reverently said, “Let us
read the Word of God.” The house was
quiet. No business on that day intruded
itself upon their minds. It was difficult
for any of them to speak, but they were
ready to hear. The passages which old
David selected for reading were 2 Samuel
xii. 15-23, Matthew ix. 18-26, and John
xi. 1-44. Having closed the book, he
said, with a trembling but solemn voice,
“God, who doeth all things according to
the counsel of His own will, has been
pleased to send us a heavy affliction.
‘The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh
away!’ May He enable us to say at
all times, ‘Blessed be the name of the
Lord.’ For whether He gives or takes
away, He is always the same in love and
mercy. If He takes away, it is but to
give something better, for He afflicts us
to make us partakers of His holiness.
Our wee one is not dead; he only
sleepeth.” Here David paused, but recovering
himself, said, “Yes, his body
sleepeth in Jesus till the resurrection
morning. He himself is with Christ.
He is alive, in his Father’s bosom. Oh,
it is strange to think o’t, and hard to
believe! but, blessed be God! it’s true,
that&mdash;that&mdash;Jesus Christ, who sees us,
sees him, and sees us thegither, ay,
enoo!&mdash;” continued David thoughtfully,
like one pondering on a new truth;
“this very minute we are all in His
sight! Oh, it’s grand and comforting;
our wee Davie is in the arms of Jesus
Christ!” A solemn silence ensued.
“The bonnie bairn will never return
to us, but we shall go to him, and
some o’ us ere lang, I hope. Let us
pray.” And they all knelt down, and
a true prayer, from a true heart, was
spoken, from suffering parents, to Him
“of whom <em>the whole family</em> in heaven and
earth is named.”</p>

<p>To David’s surprise and great satisfaction,
he heard William utter Amen
to his prayer, which included honest
confession of sin; expressions of thankfulness
for mercies, enumerating very
many mercies, among others, the great
gift of their child, thus taken away,
with thanks for all he had been, and
for all he then was; with trustful
petitions for grace to help them in
their time of need.</p>

<p>That afternoon Dr. M‘Gavin called,
and manifested quiet, unobtrusive, but
most touching sympathy. His very
silence was eloquent affection.</p>

<p>“I’m proud to meet wi’ you, sir,” said
old Armstrong, after the Doctor had
been seated for a while. “Although I’m
no’ o’ your kirk, yet we’re baith o’ ae
Kirk for a’ that.”</p>

<p>“With one Father, one Brother, one
Spirit, one life, one love, one hope!”
replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>“True, sir, true, sir, our differences
are nothing to our agreements, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Our non-essential differences arise
out of our essential union, Mr. Armstrong.
If we differ honestly and conscientiously
as brethren, I hope it is
because we differ only in judgment as
to how to please our Father, and our
Eldest Brother. Our hearts are one in
our wish to do Their will. For none
of us liveth, or dieth even, to himself.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, Doctor. So it is, so it is!
as the auld saying has’t, ‘The best men
are but men at the best.’ We maun
carry ane another’s burdens; and ignorance,
or even bigotry, is the heaviest
ony man can carry for his neebour.
Thank God, brighter and better times
are coming! We here see through a glass
darkly; but then face to face. We
know only in pairt; then shall we know
even as we are known. We must be
faithful to our given light, and serve
Him, and not man.”</p>

<p>“There are differences among living
men,” replied the Doctor, “but none
among the dead. We shall only agree
perfectly when we know and love as
saints, without error and without sin.”</p>

<p>“I mind,” said David, warming with
the conversation, and the pleasure of
getting his better heart out&mdash;“I mind
two neighbours of mine, and ye’ll mind
them too, gudewife? that was Johnnie
Morton and auld Andrew Gebbie. The
tane was a keen Burgher, and the
tother an Antiburgher. Baith lived in
the same house, though at different ends,
and it was the bargain that each should
keep his ain side o’ the house aye weel
thatched. But they happened to dispute
so desperate about the principles o’ their
kirks, that at last they quarrelled, and
didna speak. So ae day after this, as
they were on the roof thatching, each
on his ain side, they reached the tap,
and sae looking ower, face met face.
What could they do? They couldna
flee. So at last Andrew took aff his
Kilmarnock cap, and, scratching his
head, said, ‘Johnnie, you and me, I
think, have been very foolish to dispute
as we hae done as to Christ’s will aboot
our kirks, till we hae forgot His will
aboot ourselves; and so we hae fought
sae keen for what we ca’ the truth that
it has ended in brither fechting against
brither. Whatever’s wrang, this canna be
richt, if we dinna love. Noo, it strikes me
that maybe it’s wi’ the Kirk as wi’ this
hoose: ye’re working on ae side and me
on the other, but if we only do our wark
weel, we wull meet at the tap at last.
Gie’s your han’!’ And so they shook han’s,
and were the best o’ freens ever after.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Armstrong, for the
story,” said the Doctor. Then looking
to the bed, he remarked, “Oh, if we
were only simple, true, and loving, like
little children, would we not, like that
dear one, enter the kingdom of heaven,
and know and love all who were in it,
or on their way to it?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I have met you, Doctor,”
resumed the old elder. “It does ane’s
heart good to meet a brother who has
been a stranger. But if it hadna been
for his death noo, we might never have
met. Isna that queer? God’s ways are
no’ our ways.”</p>

<p>“God brings life out of death,” replied
the Doctor, “and in many ways does He
ordain praise from babes and sucklings,
whether living or dead.” Was not “wee
Davie” a home missionary to the dissenting
elder and Established Church
minister? “And now,” continued the
Doctor, “with your permission, good
friends, I will read a short psalm and
offer up a short prayer before I go.”</p>

<p>They thanked him, and he read the
23rd Psalm. His only remark was, as
he closed the Bible, “The Good Shepherd
has been pleased to take this dear lamb
into His fold, never more to leave it.”</p>

<p>“And may the lamb be the means of
making the auld sheep to follow!” added
the elder.</p>

<p>When the prayer was over, Jeanie,
who had hardly spoken a word, said,
without looking at the Doctor, “Oh,
sir, God didna hear our prayer for my
bairn!”</p>

<p>“Dinna speak that way, Jeanie
woman!” said old David softly, yet
firmly.</p>

<p>“I canna help it, father; I maun
get oot my thochts that are burning
at my heart. The minister maun forgie
me,” replied Jeanie.</p>

<p>“Surely, Mrs. Thorburn,” said the
Doctor; “and it would be a great
satisfaction to me if I could, from what
God has taught me from His Word,
and from my experience of sorrow, be
able to solve any difficulty, or help you
to acquiesce in God’s dealings with you;
not because you <em>must,</em> but because you
<em>ought</em> to submit; not because God has
<em>power</em>, and therefore does as He pleases,
but because He is Love, and therefore
pleases always to do what is right.”</p>

<p>“But, oh, He didna hear our prayer;
that’s my battle! We were maybe
wrang in asking what was against His
wull.”</p>

<p>“Not in the way, perhaps, in which
you expected, Mrs. Thorburn; yet every
true prayer is verily heard and answered
by Him. But He is too good, too wise,
too loving, to give us always literally
what we ask; if so, He would often be
very cruel, and <em>that</em> He can never be.
You would not give your child a serpent,
if in his assurance he asked one, mistaking
it for a fish; nor would you
give him a stone for bread?”</p>

<p>The Doctor paused.</p>

<p>“When Nathan, the Lord’s prophet,
telt King David that his child must
die,” said Armstrong, “yet David even
then prayed to the Lord to spare his
life, and I dinna doot that his Father
in heaven was pleased wi’ his freedom
and faith.”</p>

<p>“Right,” continued the Doctor, “for
I am sure we cannot trust Him too
much, or open our human hearts to Him
too freely; let us always remember, too,
that when God refuses what we ask,
He gives us something better&mdash;yea, far
more than we can ask or think. He gave
your dear child for a time; and if He
has taken him away, can you, for example,
tell the evil, the misery, which may have
been prevented? How many parents
would give worlds that their children
had died in infancy! And you could
not wish for more than your child’s
good, and so God has thus far literally
heard that prayer. He has done so by
taking your child to Himself. Your
precious jewel is not lost, but is in
God’s treasury, where no thief can break
through and steal; <em>that</em> is surely something.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir, it is!” said Jeanie; “but
yet it’s an awfu’ blank! Ilka thing in
the world seems different.”</p>

<p>“I’m jist thinking, Jeanie,” said Mrs.
Armstrong, “that it’s a comfort ye ever
pit yer een on Davie, for there’s puir
Mrs. Blair&mdash;John Blair’s blin’ wife, ye
ken&mdash;when she lost her callant, May was
a year, she cam’ to me in an awfu’ way
aboot it, and what vexed her sae muckle
was, that she never had seen his wee
face, and that she could only touch and
han’le him, and hear him greet.”</p>

<p>“Puir body,” remarked Jeanie, “it
was a sair misfortun’ for ony mither
that&mdash;an’ yet&mdash;But I’ll no’ think aboot
it; ilk ane has their ain burden to carry.
Noo, minister, let me speir at you, sir:
Will I never see my bairn again? and
if I see him, will I no’ ken him?”</p>

<p>“You might as well ask whether you
could see and know your child if he
had gone to a foreign country instead of
to heaven,” replied the Doctor. “Alas!
if we did not know our beloved friends
in heaven, earth in some respects would
be dearer to our hearts! But then,
ignorance is not possible in such a place
of light and love.”</p>

<p>“It wadna be rational to think so,”
remarked William, speaking for the first
time, though he had been listening with
great interest to the Doctor.</p>

<p>“But,” continued Jeanie, with quiet
earnestness, “will our bairn aye be a
bairn, Doctor? Oh, I hope so!”</p>

<p>“Dinna try, Jeanie dear,” said David,
“to be wise aboon what is written.”</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled, and asked, “If
your child had lived, think you would
you have rejoiced had he always continued
to be a child and never grown or advanced?
and are you a loss or a gain
to your father and mother, because you
have grown in mind and knowledge since
you were an infant?”</p>

<p>“I never thocht o’ that,” said Jeanie
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Be assured,” continued the Doctor,
“there will be no such abortions there
as infants in intellect and sense for ever.
All will be perfect and complete, according
to the plan of God, who made us
for fellowship with Himself and all His
blissful family. Your darling has gone
to a noble school, and will be taught
and trained there for immortality by
Him who was Himself a child, and who
knows a mother’s love and a mother’s
sorrow; and you too, parents, if you
believe in Christ, and hold fast your
confidence in Him, and become to Him
as little children, will be made fit to
enter the same society; and thus you
and your boy, though never, perhaps,
forgetting your old relationship on earth,
will be fit companions for one another
for ever and ever. Depend upon it, you
will both know and love each other
there better than you ever could have
done here.”</p>

<p>“My wee pet!” murmured Jeanie, as
the tears began to flow from a softened,
because happier, heart.</p>

<p>William hid his face in his hands.
After a while, he broke silence and
said, “These thoughts of heaven are new
to me. But common sense tells me they
maun be true. Heaven does not seem
to me noo to be the same strange place it
used to be. My loss is not so complete
as I once thought it was. Neither we
nor our bairn have lived in vain.”</p>

<p>“Surely not,” said the Doctor<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said Thorburn;

<p>Fareweel, sir! I’ll expect ye the morn
at two, if convenient,” the smith whispered
to the Doctor as he opened the
door to him.</p>

<p>“I’ll be sure to come,” he replied.
“Thank you for those verses; and think
for your good about all I have said.”</p>

<p>That evening, there was a comfortable
tea prepared by Jeanie for her friends,
and the Corporal was one of the party.
Had a stranger dropped in upon them,
he would not have supposed that there
was sorrow in the house. There is a
merciful reaction to strong feeling. The
highest waves, when they dash against
the rock, flow farthest back, and scatter
themselves in their rebound into sparkling
foam and airy bubbles. The Corporal
told some of his old stories of
weariness and famine, of wounds and
sufferings, and marches over the fields
of Spain from victory to victory. Old
Armstrong could match these only by
Covenanter tales from <cite>The Scots Worthies</cite>,
of battles long ago, but was astonished
to find the Corporal a staunch Episcopalian,
who had no sympathy with
“rebels.” Yet so kind and courteous
was the pensioner, that the elder confessed
that he was “a real fine body,
withoot a grain o’ bigotry.” William,
too, had his talk on “the times,” and
his favourite topic of reform; while
Jeanie and her mother spoke of the
farm, and of old friends among the
cows, with many bygone reminiscences
of persons and things. And thus the
weight of their hearts was lightened,
and made stronger, along with higher
and better thoughts, to carry their
burden; but ever and anon there came
one little presence before them, causing
a sinking of the heart.</p>

<p>No sooner had their friends left the
house for the night than the smith did
what he never did before. He opened
the Bible, and said to Jeanie, “I will
read a chapter aloud before we retire to
rest.”</p>

<p>Jeanie clapped her husband fondly on
the shoulder, and in silence sat down
beside him while he read again some
of the same passages which they had
already heard. Few houses had that
night more quiet and peaceful sleepers
than that house, under whose roof, beneath
the shining stars of God, those
parents and their child reposed.</p>

<p>The little black coffin was brought to
the smith’s the night before the funeral.
When the house was quiet, Davie was
laid in it gently by his father. Jeanie
stood by and assumed the duty of
arranging with care the white garments
in which her boy was dressed, wrapping
them round him, and adjusting the head
as if to sleep in her own bosom. She
brushed once more the golden ringlets,
and put the little hands in their right
place, and opened out the frills in the
cap, and removed every particle of sawdust
which soiled the shroud. When
all was finished, though she seemed
anxious to prolong the work, the lid
was put on the coffin, but so as to leave
the face uncovered. Both were as silent
as their child. But ere they retired to
rest for the night, they instinctively
went to take another look. As they
gazed in silence, side by side, the smith
felt his hand gently seized by his wife.
She played at first nervously with the
fingers, until, finding her own hand held
by her husband, she looked into his
face with an unutterable expression,
and meeting his eyes so full of unobtrusive
sorrow, she leant her head on
his shoulder and said, “Willie, this is
my last look o’ him on this side the
grave. But, Willie dear, you and me
maun see him again, and, mind ye, no’
to part&mdash;na, I canna thole that! We
ken whaur <em>he</em> is, and we maun gang
till him. Noo, promise me! vow alang
wi’ me here, that, as we love him and
ane another, we’ll attend mair to what’s
gude than we hae dune, that&mdash;oh, Willie!
forgie me, for it’s no’ my pairt to speak,
but I canna help it th’ noo, and just, my
bonnie man, just agree wi’ me&mdash;that
we’ll gie our hearts noo and for ever
to our ain Saviour, and the Saviour o’
our wee Davie!”</p>

<p>These words were uttered without
ever lifting her head from her husband’s
shoulder, and in low, broken accents,
half choked with an inward struggle,
but without a tear. She was encouraged
to say this&mdash;for she had a timid
awe for her husband&mdash;by the pressure
ever and anon returned to hers from his
hand.</p>

<p>The smith spoke not, but bent his
head over his wife, who felt his tears
falling on her neck, as he whispered,
“Amen, Jeanie! so help me, God!”</p>

<p>A silence ensued, during which Jeanie
got, as she said, “a gude greet,” for the
first time, which took a weight off her
heart. She then quietly kissed her child
and turned away.</p>

<p>Thorburn took the hand of his boy
and said, “Fareweel, Davie, and when
you and me meet again, we’ll baith, I
tak’ it, be a bit different frae what we
are this nicht!” He then put the lid
on mechanically, turned one or two of
the screws, and then sat down at the
fireside to chat about the arrangements
of the funeral as on a matter of business.</p>

<p>After that, for the first time, William
asked his wife to kneel down, and he
would pray before they retired to rest.
Poor fellow! he was sincere as ever
man was, and never after till the day
of his death did he omit this “exercise,”
which once on a day was universal in
every family whose head was a member
of the church, and I have known it
continued by the widow when her head
was taken away. But on this the first
night when the smith tried to utter
aloud the thoughts of his heart, he
could only say, “Our Father&mdash;!” There
he stopped. Something seemed to seize
him, and to stop his utterance. Did he
only know how much was in these words,
he possibly might have said more. As
it was, the thoughts of the father on
earth so mingled, he knew not how, with
those of the Father in heaven, that he
could not speak. But he continued on his
knees, and spoke there to God as he had
never spoken before. Jeanie did the same.</p>

<p>After a while they both rose, and
Jeanie said, “Thank ye, Willie. It’s a
beautifu’ beginning, and it wull, I’m
sure, hae a braw ending.”</p>

<p>“It’s cauld iron, Jeanie woman,” said
the smith, “but it wull melt and come
a’ richt.”</p>

<p>The day of the funeral was a day of
beauty and sunshine. A few fellow-tradesmen
and neighbours assembled in
the house, dressed in their Sunday’s
best, though it was visible in one or
two that the best was the worse of the
wear. The last thing a Scotch workman
will part with, even to keep his
family in food, is his Sunday clothes;
and the last duty he will fail to perform,
is following the body of a neighbour
or acquaintance to the grave. All
were dressed with crape on their hats,
and had weepers on their coats&mdash;the
Corporal wore, besides, a medal on his.
The smith, according to custom, sat near
the door, and shook each man by the
hand as he pointed to a seat. Not a
word, of course, was spoken.</p>

<p>When all who were expected had
assembled, the Doctor, who occupied a
chair near the table on which the Bible
lay, opened the Book, and after reading
a portion of it without any comment,
he prayed with a fervour and suitableness
which touched every heart. This
is our only Scotch burial service. The
little coffin was then brought out, and
was easily carried. The Corporal was
the first to step forward, and saluting
the smith by putting his hand to his
hat, soldier fashion, he begged to have
the honour of assisting. Slowly the
small procession advanced towards the
churchyard, about half a mile off; and
angels beheld that wondrous sight, a
child’s funeral&mdash;wondrous as a symbol
of sin and of redemption; of the insignificance
of a human being as a mere
creature, and of his magnificence as belonging
to Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>As they reached the grave, the birds
were singing, and a flood of light steeped
in glory a neighbouring range of hill;
while overhead, the sky had only one
small, snow-white cloud reposing in
peace on its azure blue.</p>

<p>When the sexton had finished the
<a name="spade" id="spade"></a>grave and smoothed it with his spade,
William quietly seized it, saying, “Gie
me the shool, John, and I’ll gie him the
last clap mysel’,” and he went over again
the green turf carefully with gentle
beats, and removed with his hand the
small stones and gravel which roughened
its surface. Those who stood very
near, had they been narrowly watching
him, which they had too much feeling
to do, might have observed the smith
give a peculiar, tender pressure and clap
on the grave with his hand, as on a
child’s breast, ere he returned the spade,
and with a careless air said, “Here,
John, thank ye; it’s a’ richt noo.” Then
lifting up his hat, and looking round,
added, “Thank ye, freens, for your
trouble in coming.” And so they left
“wee Davie” more precious and more
enduring than the everlasting hills!</p>

<p>Several years after this, Dr. M‘Gavin,
then a very old man, as he sat at his
study fire, was conversing with a young
preacher, who seemed to think that
nothing could be accomplished of much
value for the advancement of Christ’s
kingdom, unless by some great “effort,”
or “movement,” or “large committee,”
which would carry everything at once
by a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</em>. The Doctor quietly
remarked, “My young friend, when you
have lived as long in the ministry as I
have done, you will learn how true it is,
that ‘God fulfils Himself in many ways,’
He is in the still, small voice, and often,
too, when He is neither in the earthquake
nor in the hurricane. One of the
most valuable elders I ever had&mdash;and
whose admirable wife and daughters and
well-doing, prosperous sons are still
members of my church, and much attached
friends&mdash;told me on his dying
bed that, under God, he owed his chief
good to the death of his first child, the
circumstance which accidentally made
me acquainted with him. On the last
evening of his life, when enumerating
the many things which had been blessed
for his good, he said to me, ‘But under
God it was my wee Davie that did
it a’!’”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
